I guess\\n&quot;\\n\\nBut Highfinger was gone.\\n\\n&quot;Pardon me, Sir. Be you Mr. Saxon?&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Yessir. What can I do for you?&quot;\\n&quot;Can you fight?&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Never again. I have just returned from six\\n\\nmonths in France, shooting down Hun aero\\n\\nplanes, and won t have any more scrapping. I m\\na peace man forevermore.&quot;\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\n&quot;Give us your hand, old boy: you re my pal\\nand pilot. I m a prospector from Rochester,\\nNevada. You can always count on a prospector\\n\\nstarting something, and I m I mean we, now,\\nare going to start a revolution in Mexico.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Then you ll have to go alone, old sport, so\\n\\nfar as I m concerned; for I m not fostering any\\nrevolutions outside of Ben Saxon s own private\\n\\ngraveyard, and even there I don t bury anything\\n\\nexcept good resolutions.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;But listen to me, Saxon, for a minute. You\\n\\nmust have come to Nogales to make money.\\n\\nNo sane man would come for any other reason,\\n\\nexcept health, and you sure look healthy now.\\n\\nI m here to show you how to make money, lots\\nof it, quickly and honestly.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;All right, Mr. what s your name, Highfinger,\\n\\nfire away. I m all attention.&quot;\\nThree fingers were missing from the old man s\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\n\\nHighfinger s Story\\n\\nleft hand, and the index finger that remained\\n\\nwas pointing straight up now, and his whole\\n\\nbody was quivering with intense earnestness.\\n\\n&quot;See that hand, Saxon? Three ringers bit off.\\n\\nNo, I m not sayin what bit em off, but losin\\nem has kept me out of more n a million fights.\\n\\nYessum. A fellow can t make much of a fist\\nwith only one finger. When I double that up,\\n\\nso, the other fellow most always laughs, and\\n\\nthe fight is all off. You see, I m veteran of a\\nthousand fierce arguments. When that finger\\n\\npoints straight up, so, it just nachelly draws\\n\\ninspiration from the starry firmament same as a\\n\\ntrolley pulls juice from a live wire or a preacher\\n\\ngets eloquence from a big collection. Yessum.\\n\\nBut when it points straight out, so, it shoots\\n\\nconviction faster n a Colt automatic can shoot\\n\\nsteel-nosed bullets.\\n\\n&quot;Y see, Saxon, I broke up a riot in Nevada\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nwith that finger. Fact. Durin the stampede in\\n\\nRochester, a dozen men workin an twenty-five\\n\\nhundred idle, J. B. Darnes, known as The\\n\\nJackhammer Kid, just out o Comstock, started\\n\\nauction sale on three kegs of peach brandy.\\n\\nYessum. An about fifty fellows chipped in and\\n\\nbought em didn t care for the brandy just\\n\\nwanted to help the auctioneer out. Kind-hearted,\\n\\nthat s it. But when they opened em, twan t\\n\\npeach brandy at all. No, sir. Just grape juice\\n\\nthat wouldn t make the drunk come inside of\\n\\ntwelve hours. Think o that! Waitin twelve\\n\\nhours for a drunk to come when a fellow s in\\n\\na hurry. Y its a crime. A prospector can t\\nwait always for returns. He s used to quick\\n\\nmoney, or none, mostly none, an that was the\\n\\nmaddest bunch you ever saw. An\\nr\\nwhen some\\n\\none said Darnes was at the Palace Saloon run by\\n\\nGeorge De Luke, at the lower end of the gulch\\n12\\n\\n\\n\\nHighfinger s Story\\n\\nthey called Main Street, they started that way,\\n\\nan everybody joined the parade till it was two\\n\\nthousand strong an more n a hundred per cent\\n\\ncrazy, an rollin down that gulch like a cloud\\n\\nburst.\\n\\n&quot;I had just come out of Mother Wilson s soup\\n\\nbrewery chock full o chile con carne and horse\\n\\nradish, an my voltage was runnin dangerously\\n\\nhigh. An when I see all them two thousand\\n\\nminers all in evenin dress (every one of em had\\n\\non a six shooter an most of em two), I knew\\n\\nextinctively my hour had come. Yessum. The\\n\\nbell of destiny was soundin in my ears louder n\\n\\nan airplane motor goin two hundred miles an\\n\\nhour, an I thought it must jar the universe. So\\n\\nI climbed on a big boulder an shouted, Fellow-\\n\\nplutocrats and multi-millionaires, that auctioneer\\n\\nfellow, Jackhammer Kid, left for Oreana over n\\n\\nhour ago, and I m commissioned by the Holy Gee\\n13\\n\\n\\n\\nof Rome [Of course I meant the Holy See, or\\n\\nOcean, whichever it is, but the crowd was up in\\n\\n&quot;G&quot;]\\nto tell you about the richest gold diggin s\\n\\never located on this planet or any other satellite\\n\\nor malachite of the solar and lunatic system.\\n\\nThen a swamper from Goodsprings, Nevada,\\n\\nshouted, How about the Breyfogle ? An I\\n\\nsays, Gentlemen, honest to goodness, the Brey\\n\\nfogle, Pegleg, Morning Star, Lost Gunsight and\\n\\nLost Aztec mines all put together wouldn t count\\n\\nas a penny ante in the Golden Treasures of the\\n\\nYaki Indians in Mexico. Mark you, the first\\n\\ntreasure. For they have seven treasures, each\\n\\none growin richer, an I ve located the seventh,\\n\\nSelah!\\n\\n&quot;By\\nthat time this ringer was pointin hori\\n\\nzontal an throwin sparks of conviction into them\\n\\nfellers faster n limburger cheese can discharge\\n\\ndelicious odors. Well, Sir, believe me or not,\\n14\\n\\n\\n\\nHighfinger s Story\\n\\nbut inside o ten minutes that whole menagerie\\n\\nwas singin , We ll all be gay old millionaires\\nwhen Pay Day comes again, and every one of\\n\\nthem was figurin how he could slip away that\\n\\nnight and be the first to hit the trail for Mexico.\\n\\nSuch is the power of truth. Yessum.\\n\\n&quot;Now to get down to business, Saxon, I don t\\n\\nwant to start a revolution in Mexico, nor any\\n\\nwhere else at present; but I do know that there\\n\\nare millions and millions of dollars of gold in a\\n\\ngulch on Yaki Indian lands in Mexico, not doin\\n\\nthem nor anybody any good, and I want a\\n\\nHundred Thousand of that gold. Not any more\\n\\nnor any less. It will take just an even hundred\\n\\nthousand to do what I must do before I die.\\n\\nYou see, I ve had four stakes in my time : seventy-\\nfive thousand once in Colorado, fifty thousand in\\n\\nIdaho, thirty thousand in South Africa, and\\n\\ntwenty-five thousand in Nevada. In fact, I ve\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\ngot twenty-five thousand deposited in that bank\\n\\nover there now; but that will not do. I must\\n\\nhave a hundred thousand, and if you ll help me,\\n\\nI ll get the same for you inside of thirty days.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;But, Mr. Highfinger, if that belongs to the\\n\\nYakis, we have no more right to take it from\\n\\nthem than from some white man in Arizona. I\\n\\nhave a conscience, and it s just this grabbing\\n\\nthings you happen to \\\\vant that has made four\\n\\nyears of hell in Europe, and buried seventy\\n\\nthousand of our American boys in French soil.\\n\\nThe Kaiser wanted some French coal and iron\\n\\nmines, and without regard to others rights,\\n\\nwithout fear of God, Man or Devil, has slaugh\\ntered millions of human beings and almost bank\\n\\nrupted a world in an insane attempt to take\\n\\nthem. And now you and thousands of other\\n\\ncitizens of the United States say, To hades with\\n\\nthe Yakis and Mexicans. We want their lands\\n16\\n\\n\\n\\nHighfinger s Story\\n\\nand mines. Of course we do not want to resort\\n\\nto bullets and bayonets, but we must have the\\n\\ngoods. All the difference between us and the\\n\\nKaiser is, he had the courage of his convictions\\n\\nand avarice, and built up a militarism of men\\n\\nand materials, physical force, while we Ameri\\n\\ncans build a militarism of brains and commercial\\n\\nshrewdness, intellectual force. But one is just\\n\\nas conscienceless as the other, and must erelong\\n\\nwork out universal destruction of race and gov\\n\\nernments. Financial insanity is paralyzing con\\n\\nscience in the United States in particular and the\\n\\nwhite race in general. I believe the other fellow\\n\\nhas as many rights as I have.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Charming, charming, Mr. Saxon ; mighty\\n\\ngood doctrine for reformers. But you and I\\n\\nain t reformers, and if we were, Nogales is not\\n\\nthe best place to start something. God helps\\n\\nthem that helps themselves. Keep what you get\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nand get what you can, is good enough motto for\\n\\nme and about seventy millions other Americans.\\n\\nMexico is the richest country on earth, but the\\n\\nYakis nor Mexicans haven t got sense enough to\\n\\nuse it, and I say, Clean em up. Make em\\n\\nbehave, so we U. S. boys can go in and get\\n\\nconcessions we want, or take the whole bloomin\\n\\ncountry and develop the matchless resources for\\n\\nthe present generation. Every fellow for him\\n\\nself. Forward!\\n&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Yes, Mr. Highfinger, I know that s the\\n\\nslogan of power to-day; but you know as well\\n\\nas I do, it s dead wrong. The time, has come\\n\\nwhen this old world s affairs must be run on this\\n\\nplatform, Equal rights to all. Special privileges\\n\\nto none, or skid to failure everlasting.\\n\\n&quot;If this hellish European war is to be of any\\n\\ngood to humanity, politics and politicians must\\n\\ntake a back pew, and governments be run for\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\n\\nHighfinger s Story\\n\\nthe benefit of the governed. You know, every\\n\\nsane thinking man knows, there is not a pure\\n\\ndemocracy on earth to-day. Probably the good\\n\\nold U. S. A. comes the nearest to it. But Presi\\n\\ndent Wilson advised war, Congress voted it, and\\n\\nnine million boys practically repudiated that vote\\n\\nby refusing to volunteer. Had to be drafted.\\n\\nAnd when the millions of boys were lined up to\\n\\nbare their breasts to the crimson tide of European\\n\\nslaughter, then, I say, Congress with unblush\\n\\ning treason refused to draft even eighty per cent\\n\\nof strictly war profits, and, hiding behind the\\n\\nmask of patriotism, practically forced the fathers\\n\\nand mothers of these same boys to buy the bonds\\n\\nto finance the wholesale murder. And it is a\\n\\nsafe bet that, if those with incomes above five\\n\\nthousand a year had been pushed as hard for\\n\\nbond subscriptions as those with incomes below\\n\\nthat figure were, instead of raising twenty bil-\\n\\n19\\n\\n\\n\\nlions we should have raised seventy to a hundred\\n\\nbillions. And, what is more, the government\\n\\nthat has a right to draft men has an equal right\\n\\nto draft money, foodstuffs, clothing and muni\\n\\ntions of wrar without guaranteeing payment with\\n\\nfour per cent interest. And I ll tell you, Mr.\\n\\nHighfinger, that just as long as money and prop\\n\\nerty is more sacred than human life, just so\\n\\nlong there will be wars. And whenever the\\n\\nUnited States, or any other nation, prepares for\\n\\nwar, even under claim of Keeping the Peace,\\n\\nsome other nation will call the bluff\\n;\\nand when\\n\\nthat time comes, Asia s eight hundred millions\\n\\nwill be in the game, and may the Eternal God\\n\\nhave mercy on our souls. Them s my sentiments,\\nand I guess you and I cannot do any business\\n\\nnow.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Mr. Saxon, I agree with you absolutely. I\\n\\nbeg your pardon for raising this question, but I\\n\\n20\\n\\n\\n\\nHighfinger s Story\\n\\nwanted to know the temper and spirit of my man.\\n\\nNobody knows better than we prospectors that\\n\\nwe have outraged Mexico. We have violated the\\n\\nsanctity of her homes. And while I do not want\\n\\nthat Columbus affair repeated, I do know that\\n\\nthe Mexican government was not responsible for\\n\\nit. And I also know that for every bit of deviltry\\n\\ninflicted upon Americans in recent years, Mexi\\n\\ncan people have suffered ten times as much at\\n\\nthe hands of conscienceless white brigands, pro-\\n\\nmotors and concessionaires, who have gone to\\n\\nMexico for private gain. If a man must leave\\n\\nthe United States to make money, let him carry\\n\\nhis own insurance; don t ask the government to\\n\\nunderwrite his private enterprises. But in this\\n\\ncase of mine I think I can show you that I have\\n\\na full right to the hundred thousand I ask for.\\n\\n&quot;Ten years ago I was working in, Cananea\\n\\nCopper Mines some months, then decided to go\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nto Guymas, and from there to, perhaps, prospect\\n\\nsome. From the Mexican government there I\\n\\ngot written permission to prospect, and drove my\\n\\nown burro into the Lastuna Hills and was doing\\n\\nsome placering, washing out about an ounce of\\n\\ndust a day. One evening when I returned to\\n\\nmy hogan in the sagebrush, I found a wounded\\n\\nYaki there. He spoke Spanish well and English\\n\\nfairly, so we had no trouble understanding each\\n\\nother. He told me he wras related to Iximaga,\\nChief of the Yakis, descending on the father s\\n\\nside from pure Toltec. Was commissioned by\\nhis people to visit Gov. Cantu, Ensenada, Lower\\n\\nCalifornia, to arrange, if possible, for the trans\\n\\nfer of the peninsula to the Yakis for permanent\\n\\npossession. Failing in this, he had returned to\\n\\nGuymas, leaving there for home by way of\\n\\nHermosillo. Had been set upon by a band of\\n\\ngringo and peon bandits, beaten, robbed, shot and\\n\\n22\\n\\n\\n\\nHighfinger s Story\\n\\nleft to die. He surely had the spirit of a man\\n\\nif it was in the body of a Yaki. He had been\\n\\nshot through the right lung. I did all I could\\n\\nfor him the week he lived, and before he died\\n\\nhe gave me this signet ring, also a bit of paper\\n\\nwith a message in Spanish to Iximaga, which\\n\\ntold of his sad experience and approaching death\\n\\nand cleared me. Also he described carefully the\\n\\nlocation of the Yaki seventh treasure, and author\\n\\nized me to take a hundred thousand in gold.\\n\\n&quot;Well, I buried him, then went after the gold\\n\\nfirst, intending later, if I really found the gold,\\n\\nto carry this ring and message to Iximaga at\\n\\nTruxlan. I really found the treasure all right\\n\\nand had about eighty thousand in dust when, one\\n\\nnight, three beacons flamed from nearby hills,\\n\\nand I knew I was discovered. Right there I fell\\n\\ndown. I should have stood my ground, stated\\n\\nmy case, showed the ring, and taken the paper\\n23\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nto headquarters; but I started to run, and say,\\n\\nSaxon, that was some chase. You know a fellow\\n\\nonce starts to run, there s only two landings.\\n\\nOne is freedom, the other hell. Well, I got\\n\\nboth, but I got freedom last. Yessum. Well,\\n\\nthe first night I stumbled into a cave which\\n\\nproved to be a treasure vault, actually tons of\\n\\ngold there, boulders of pure gold as large as\\n\\nyour head, slabs of it as large as the floor of\\n\\nthat tent over there, and a foot thick. I stayed\\n\\nthere the next day, but my stock of tortillas was\\n\\nsmall and water less; so the second night I\\n\\ncrawled out and headed for the North Star.\\n\\nBut somehow those red bronzed devils scented\\n\\nmy trail, and for six days and nights it was a\\n\\ncase of Monkey and the weasel, till I headed\\n\\ninto Hermosillo, less than a hundred miles from\\n\\nthe treasure.\\n\\n&quot;Now, Saxon, I want you to go with me after\\n\\n24\\n\\n\\n\\nliighfinger s Story\\n\\nthat hundred thousand. I have a right to it, and\\n\\nan airship is the only way to get it.&quot;\\n\\nThe old man had told the story with such\\n\\ndeadly earnestness and tragic humor that Saxon\\n\\nfelt he had almost experienced the suffering of\\n\\nthat perilous flight and was fully convinced that\\n\\nHighfinger had spoken the truth.\\n\\nThat night they took the train for U.

S. cruisers swung at anchorage in the offing,\\n\\nwhile airplanes whirred with magic and North\\n\\n26\\n\\n\\n\\nMagic Mystery Maid\\n\\nIsland trembled under the &quot;Cavalry of the\\n\\nClouds.&quot;\\n\\nSaxon met half a dozen aces fresh from the\\n\\nskyline of Europe, and lived again those awful\\n\\neternities of chance when they together photo\\n\\ngraphed enemy &quot;formations,&quot; bombed cities, and\\n\\nturned hell loose upon the German aero-squad\\n\\nrons from the forests of Argonne to the hills of\\n\\nVerdun.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Highfinger kept close watch of\\n\\nthe metal and canvas vultures as they breasted\\n\\nthe air, climbed by ever-widening circles to view\\n\\nless heights, or dropped through loops and nose\\n\\nspins to seeming destruction.\\n\\n&quot;Saxon,&quot; said Admiral Brooks, &quot;the De Havi-\\n\\nland is at your disposal whenever you wish to\\n\\ngive us a demonstration of battle flight. I hope\\n\\nyou feel equal to it, for the day is ideal; and\\n\\nthe boys here know what you did Over There,\\n\\n27\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nand are anxious to see the machine in the hands\\n\\nof a real veteran.&quot;\\n\\nThe machine indicated was the largest, strong\\n\\nest and speediest machine on the West Coast, and\\n\\nhad just been priced to Highfinger at a figure he\\n\\nwas willing to accept.\\n\\nAs Saxon felt the throb of her engines and\\n\\ntook the breath from her propeller blades, his\\n\\nbody, soul and spirit seemed transformed. His\\n\\nblood surged in waves, his nerves became tense\\n\\nas drawn steel springs, the fashion of his coun\\n\\ntenance became blood and flame, while his galena-\\n\\ngray eyes became as molten silver. The mania\\n\\nof conflict seized his soul. Human limitations\\n\\nvanished. He glowed before them, an &quot;Immortal\\n\\nSpirit of Conflict,&quot; an engine of destruction,\\n\\nwithout sense of fear or power of retreat, an\\n\\nunclothed, elemental force, eager to be hurled\\n\\ninto that cauldron of death where Satan flung\\n\\n28\\n\\n\\n\\nMagic Mystery Maid\\n\\nhis legions on and spectre hosts battle above the\\n\\npits of the damned.\\n\\n&quot;Highfinger, come on; we will take a spin.&quot;\\n\\nWithout a moment s hesitation the old man\\n\\nstepped into the bomb thrower s pit. Saxon\\n\\npulled the throttle wide open, threw the reverse\\n\\nlever into working position, carefully released\\n\\nthe clutch, and with a tremendous roar they were\\n\\noff, like an unhooded falcon sure of its prey.\\n\\nStraight across the flying field toward the sharp\\n\\nsalt breath of the landless blue, higher, faster,\\n\\nan Immelmann turn, but ever climbing,\\n\\n&quot;Till the soul is lost in wonder\\n\\nMid fadeless scenes of phantom splendor,&quot;\\n\\ninto a mist of cloud where icy cold wind whistled\\n\\nthrough struts and ribs, and hail rattled on wings\\n\\nand rudder bands, and streams of spray sheeted\\n\\n29\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nfrom controller flukes, halos of rainbow colors\\n\\nplayed round propeller blades and irridescent\\n\\nlights streamed from rudder bands in blazing\\n\\ngrandeur. Anon, into sunlight they shot as into\\n\\nseas of flame, up, up, the mighty motors never\\n\\nmissing a note, six, eight, ten, twelve, thirteen\\n\\nthousand feet. The city blocks blurred into\\n\\nunbroken levels, Coronado seemed a mighty\\n\\nscimetar, North Island its hilt, while the Harbor\\n\\nof the Sun and the Sunset Sea shone like a sea\\n\\nof glass in the Revelator s vision. Fifteen thou\\n\\nsand feet the aneroid registered ere Saxon re\\n\\nduced the fuel and started in a nose spin for ten\\n\\nthousand feet. Highfinger s ears roared like a\\n\\nBessemer blast, and surely death to Saxon and\\n\\nhimself, with utter destruction of the plane and\\n\\nall his plans, seemed only a matter of seconds;\\n\\nand another turn, when Saxon suddenly reversed\\n\\nthe controller flukes, the plane slanted to hori-\\n\\n30\\n\\n\\n\\nMagic Mystery Maid\\n\\nzontal, cushioned a few swift turns, easily took\\n\\nthe sand and anchored in front of the hangar.\\n\\n&quot;Well, Highfinger, how do you like it? Do\\n\\nyou think we can prospect Culiacan, stampede\\n\\nthe Yakis and bring home the dust?&quot;\\n\\nStill white around the gills, but game to the\\n\\nend, the old man laughed back, &quot;Say, Saxon, if\\n\\nthe Jackhammer Kid and Nete Pelson were here,\\n\\nthey d give all their rights in the Breyfogle for\\n\\na spin like that; and when they got through,\\n\\nthey d be so intoxicated with pleasure, they d say,\\n\\nThank you, Lady, and that Yaki treasure is\\n\\njust as good as minted now.&quot;\\n\\nA moment later he continued, &quot;I have a pro\\ngram for to-morrow, but after that you can\\n\\narrange for all entertainments where the De\\n\\nHaviland is concerned.&quot;\\n\\nThe following morning Saxon looked across\\n\\n31\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nthe breakfast table and said, &quot;What s your pro\\n\\ngram for to-day, old higrader?&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Well, if it s all the same to you, I d like to\\n\\ngo up in the hills above De Luz and pick up a\\n\\nfew carats of white obsidian, or, as commonly\\n\\nknown, California diamonds; then joy ride over\\n\\nEl Cajon, the Cuyamacas, Warner s Hot Springs,\\n\\nTernecula, Lake Elsinore and on to Riverside\\n\\naviation field. So much for the going. For the\\n\\nreturn well, I ll tell you about that later.&quot;\\n\\nThe glories of that perfect day were a never-\\n\\nto-be-forgotten joy to both of these men.\\n\\nTo Saxon, fresh from the slaughter plains of\\n\\nEurope, where pestilence walked in darkness and\\n\\ndestruction wasted at noonday, when hell swept\\n\\nthrough happy homes and devastation cycloned\\n\\ncities and towns; where famine and flame\\n\\nscourged farm and vineyard, and forests became\\n\\ncemeteries for windrows of slain, the orchards\\n\\n32\\n\\n\\n\\nMagic Mystery Maid\\n\\nof the &quot;Sunkist Vale,&quot; San Pasqual, Poway and\\n\\nEl Cajon were &quot;Fair as a garden of the Lord.&quot;\\n\\nTo Highfinger, after wearying years upon desert\\n\\nwash of sand and sage, the pine clad hills and\\n\\noak dotted vales of the Cuyamacas brought sweet\\n\\nremembrance of boyhood days, when he had\\n\\nroamed the picturesque solitudes of the &quot;Blue\\n\\nRidge&quot; ere the blight of sin had ruined his life\\n\\nor the curse of crime had blasted hope.\\n\\nLeisurely they loafed above the Carlsbad of\\n\\nthe Pacific, Temecula (the Dream of Paradise),\\n\\nLake Elsinore (Mighty Basin of Liquid Indigo)\\n\\nset in empurpled mountains, Riverside s magnolia\\n\\nlanes and orange groves, and on to March avia\\n\\ntion field, where a hundred artificial eagles\\n\\nflashed their white wings through fleecy films of\\n\\ncloud or roared their way o er rugged buttes to\\n\\nGorgoni s snow clad heights. Returning like an\\n\\nunleashed spirit, the De Haviland soared above\\n\\n33\\n\\n\\n\\nthe San Jacinto, earthquaked and thunder riven,\\n\\nstanding guard above the famished beaches of a\\n\\nwasted sea, then back to North Island, when\\n\\npurple twilight settled over the Harbor of the\\n\\nSun and the afterglow flamed its magic glory\\n\\nacross the sunset sea.\\n\\nOn the morrow mechanics were busy wTith the\\n\\ngiant De Haviland. Her pulse was tested, her\\n\\nmotors tuned, oil and gas tanks enlarged to\\n\\ncapacity for two thousand miles, lockers for\\n\\nsupplies, water tanks and secret chambers for\\n\\ntreasure chests supplied, until Highfinger was\\n\\ndelighted and Saxon knew possible emergencies\\n\\nwere provided for.\\n\\nOne glorious morning, when a sapphire sky\\n\\ndomed high above the Harbor of the Sun and\\n\\ngolden sunshine fell in caressing waves over land\\n\\nand sea, and hills and valleys were garmented in\\n\\nrobes fit for the ascension morning, while North\\n\\n34\\n\\n\\n\\nMagic Mystery Maid\\n\\nIsland pulsed to the rhythm of mighty motors\\n\\nand contending tides boomed and thundered spray\\n\\nand spume along the white sands of Coronado,\\n\\nthe giant De Haviland left her hangars for the\\n\\nuncharted realms, cushioned against the western\\n\\nbreeze, circled, looped, climbed, shook the salt\\n\\ndewdrops from her shining flanks, and headed,\\n\\nstraight as a beam of light, for the &quot;Lands of\\n\\nUnclouded Day.&quot;\\n\\nAbove the Cuyamacas, beyond the salton sea,\\n\\nacross the mighty flood of the Western Nile.\\n\\nover the changeless but ever-changing desert\\n\\nwastes, on and on with unwearied wings to the\\n\\ndrifting sands of a dry lake on the outskirts of\\n\\na borderland city, where the Jackhammer Kid\\n\\nand scores of other empire builders had gathered\\n\\nto see Highfinger s new prospecting outfit.\\n\\n&quot;Well, Highfinger, old scout, you surely put\\n\\none over on us this time, and the drinks would\\n\\n35\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\ncertainly be on us ; but, since this infernal country\\n\\n\\\\vent dry, we cannot cultivate a thirst. But\\n\\nsay, old timer, what are you goin to call the\\n\\nGirl? Flivver nor Tin Lizzie won t do at all,\\n\\nat all; but she must have a name, and you ll just\\n\\nhave to tell us which way lies your Land o\\n\\nDreams. Old boy, we must know that.&quot;\\n\\nThen the balloting for a name began.\\n\\nCleopatra, Cactus Queen, Quo Vadis, Pioneer\\n\\nPrincess, Sweetheart, Honey Bunch, etc., the list\\n\\nwas long, and each had enthusiastic supporters;\\n\\nbut it was the Kid that settled the question.\\n\\n&quot;Boys,&quot;\\nsaid he, &quot;I had a vision last night.\\n\\nYes, I did. You know when drinks were plenty,\\n\\nI could have a vision any old time ; now they are\\n\\nscarce and come high; but I put one through last\\n\\nnight and can tell you all about this Squeeze\\n\\nand the port she s headed for.\\n\\n36\\n\\n\\n\\nMagic Mystery Maid\\n\\n&quot;Highfinger will sail on the Winds of Any\\n\\nwhere, for the Islands of Somewhere, in the\\n\\nSeas of Everywhere, after the Gold of Nowhere,\\n\\nand I christen this bird The Magic Mystery\\n\\nMaid, and we will paint three M s on her\\nbeak and wings.&quot;\\n\\nWhen pressed for date of sailing, Highfinger\\nsaid :\\n\\n&quot;Birds, beasts and men are guided by invisible\\n\\nbut eternal programs. In animals we call it\\n\\ninstinct; in men, judgment; in women, intuition.\\n\\nThe gambler calls it luck; the poet, -inspiration ;\\n\\nthe preacher calls it vision or revelation. The\\n\\ngypsies have visions, and we prospectors call it\\n\\na hunch. Likewise every successful prospector\\n\\nfollows the leadings of four signs. The Kid here\\n\\ncan tell you of three of them after I am gone.\\nI ll tell you of the fourth now. Once every\\n\\n37\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nyear, generally between the vernal equinox and\\n\\nsummer solstice, the Aztec moon fulls at almost\\n\\nbloodred and shows the face of the Toltec Queen\\n\\nsmiling. I think the moon fulls to-night, and if\\n\\nthe lady s face is there, we will sail to-morrow.&quot;\\n\\nWhen the morning sun shot jewelled flame\\n\\nacross the Elephant Butte Dam and waked magic\\n\\nmirage across the wide-flung sagebrush swamps\\n\\nof Sonora, even unto the gates of Culiacan, the\\n\\nMystery Maid circled far and high, then dropped\\n\\nlow above the watching boys. Highfinger leaned\\n\\nfar over the side, waving a fond good-by, and\\n\\na moment later a crumpled paper fell at the feet\\n\\nof the Jackhammer Kid. Straightening it out,\\n\\nwith a mist of tears before his eyes, the Kid read\\n\\nthe old prospector s message, Byron s immortal\\n\\nline to his wife, &quot;Fare you well, and if forever,\\n\\nforever fare you well.&quot; As he read, a chill fell\\n\\n38\\n\\n\\n\\nMagic Mystery Maid\\n\\nupon the hearts of the boys, which the desert sun\\n\\nhad no power to dispel.\\n\\nAh, those desert friendships! Together they\\n\\nhad slept on the hot sands, under velvet skies and\\n\\ntwinkling stars, and exchanged dreams of happy\\n\\ndays gone by and happier dreams of days to come.\\n\\nThey had drunk from the same canteen the few\\n\\nlast hot drops of alkali water, then tramped\\n\\nthrough the shimmering heat of sage and sun-baked\\n\\nwash in search of water, until thirst wasted their\\n\\nbodies, heat madness crazed their brains, and\\n\\ntheir tongues protruded from cracked and bleed\\n\\ning lips. They had snuggled together in frozen\\n\\ncanyons when wood was scarce, grub run low,\\n\\nthe vein &quot;pinched&quot; and values disappeared; when\\n\\nhope changed to despair ; when laughter became\\n\\ngroans and wishes turned to curses, and hell and\\n\\nstarvation was the next camping place.\\n\\nMeanwhile, they watched the climbing Maid\\n\\n39\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nnow circling wide and high till she disappeared\\n\\nin the shoreless blue, and wondered if Highfinger\\n\\nand Saxon would sail if they knew, now, all that\\n\\nlay within that &quot;Shadow Land of Dreams.&quot;\\n\\n40\\n\\n\\n\\nHighfmger s Last Journey\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nHIGHFIXGER S LAST JOURNEY\\n\\nOver sand and sage, butte and barancho, moor\\n\\nand mesa, the Mystery Maid held steadily on\\n\\nuntil Hermosillo, a white checker board in the\\n\\nshimmering heat, was passed, then swerved sharp\\n\\nly to the southeast, sailing on and on through\\n\\namber sunshine o er the Lastuna Hills to the very\\n\\nbase of Castile Leon, beyond which lay the fertile\\n\\nvales and pasture mesas of the Yakis, outstretch\\n\\ning toward the shadowy outlines of the Mexican\\n\\nCordilleras.\\n\\nTo the north and west of Castile Leon, snug\\n\\ngled close beneath his giant shoulders, lies a small\\n\\nbut picturesque valley, guarded by small but\\n\\nsharp toothed buttes. Buried by the Creator s\\n\\nhands, here lies- the seventh treasure of the Yakis.\\n\\n41\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nFar up the rugged heights of Castile Leon\\n\\nlies a mighty basin, walled in by almost im\\n\\npenetrable thickets of chaparral and manzanite.\\n\\nHere the Mystery Maid came safely to anchor,\\n\\nwell protected from storm or wind, and perfectly\\n\\nscreened from human sight, except from a tre\\n\\nmendous lava flow far up towards the mountain s\\n\\nsummit. Close to where the Maid landed, rose\\n\\na perpendicular cliff, from whose base gushed a\\n\\nsplendid spring. Here the weary argonauts\\n\\npitched their tent and rested in the fragrant\\n\\nshadows till purple twilight charmed a world to\\n\\nslumber and these happy exiles rolled themselves\\n\\nin blankets by the light of a languorous moon\\n\\nand blazing stars, and dreamed of golden fortune\\n\\nand fond hopes realized.\\n\\nNext day they explored the generous park, but\\n\\nventured not beyond, keeping close watch the\\n\\n42\\n\\n\\n\\nHighfinger s Last Journey\\n\\nwhile for human being or sign thereof, and find\\n\\ning none.\\n\\nThe second morning, with picks, shovels and\\n\\nwell rilled canteens, they set off for the treasure\\n\\nlands far below. Through thorny thickets and\\n\\nrugged gulches, over ridges, spurs and lava slides\\n\\ninfested with vicious sidewinders, they cheered\\n\\neach other on, till at last they stood exactly where\\n\\nHighfinger stood ten years before and fled in hot\\n\\nhaste and terrors of hell from the pursuing Yakis.\\n\\nSix days they toiled, from early dawn clearing\\n\\nshallow sands and gathering shining nuggets from\\n\\npotholes and crevices of bedrock, returning each\\n\\ntwilight hour to the Mystery Maid \\\\vith bags\\n\\nof gold, until by actual weight they had more\\n\\nthan ninety thousand dollars safe writhin the De\\n\\nHaviland s secret lockers.\\n\\nThe seventh and last day Highfinger led the\\n\\nway by a different route, hoping to rediscover the\\n\\n43\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\ngold-lined cave where he had hidden from his\\n\\npursuers.\\n\\nMore than half the day they searched the\\n\\nmountain side before they were rewarded. Once\\n\\nthey had found the matchless treasure, every\\n\\nother consideration was forgotten, and they gave\\n\\nthemselves to explore chambers, drifts, corridors\\n\\nand stopes, until at length they came upon a fast\\n\\nflowing stream that leaped into a mighty chasm\\n\\nand plunged with thunder roar into an under\\n\\nground lake. Following the stream some distance,\\n\\nthey emerged into a spacious chamber or resting\\n\\nstation, and stumbled onto the mummies of\\n\\nseveral ancient miners, surrounded with tools of\\n\\nhardened copper, and realized they were in the\\n\\nmuch sought, long lost Aztec mine whence came\\n\\nthe gold that had adorned the temples of the\\n\\nMontezumas and enriched the Spanish galleons\\n\\nof Cortez.\\n\\n44\\n\\n\\n\\nHighfinger s Last Journey\\n\\nSight of these ghastly human forms, shrivelled\\n\\nby blasting heat or deadly gas, or whatever form\\n\\nof sudden death, so thoroughly surprised and\\n\\nunnerved these reckless buccaneers, they fled in\\n\\nhaste from the chamber of horrors, nor slackened\\n\\ntheir pace until, safe outside the gold lined moun\\n\\ntain, they breathed the sweet air of heaven, felt\\n\\nthe warmth of blessed sunshine, and thanked God\\n\\nfor life and strength and other almost forgotten\\n\\nblessings, and realized there are some things more\\n\\nto be desired than much coarse gold.\\n\\nIn the chemistry of life the reaction of a soul\\n\\nsometimes makes speech imperative and com\\n\\npanionship the only preventative of utter insanity.\\n\\nThe younger man broke the silence with a\\n\\nquestion that was characteristic of Western\\n\\nfrankness in general and a prospector s straight\\n\\nforwardness in particular.\\n\\n&quot;Well, Highfinger, what do you think of the\\n\\n45\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nprospect? Is it a real strike, or\\n1 are we deceiving\\n\\nourselves? Do you suppose we ll be as good\\n\\nlooking skates as those fellows when we ve been\\n\\ndead a thousand years more or less?&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Saxon, did you notice that big fellow with\\n\\nthe large eyes over to the left there?&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Well, didn t I?&quot;\\n\\n&quot;The expression on his face was living death.\\n\\nIf hell is any worse than that, I don t want to\\n\\nbe introduced, wouldn t recognize it on the\\n\\nstreet. He must have committed some crime, for\\n\\nhe had the look a criminal surely must have when\\n\\nsuddenly ushered into the presence of the Ever-\\n\\nliving God. His face was guilt, regret and re\\n\\nmorse wrought into immortality. And that little\\n\\nweazel-faced shrimp sitting on that slab of gold,\\n\\nI ll bet he was a spy, detective, plain-clothes man\\n\\ndeceit, fraud, cunning, petrified. He sure\\n\\nlooked the part.&quot;\\n\\n46\\n\\n\\n\\nHighfinger s Last Journey\\n\\nThe afternoon shadows were growing long\\n\\nbefore they reached the &quot;diggins&quot;; but an un\\n\\nusually rich pothole produced all and more than\\n\\nwas needed to complete the hundred thousand,\\n\\nand the setting sun saw them ready for the return\\n\\nto the Mystery Maid; but the climb would be\\n\\nlong, the night dark, and they decided to wait\\n\\nuntil morning.\\n\\nWrapped in their blankets, they watched the\\n\\nafterglow fade into a perfect night. The mar\\n\\nvelous charm of the twilight hour threw its name\\n\\nless spell over heart and memory till the stars\\n\\ncame out and God s own holy night silences filled\\n\\nthe interminable spaces and wrashed out all grime\\nand dust from a soul s desires. Twas such an\\n\\nhour as brings to the surface the best of character\\n\\nand conscience, plan and purpose, thought and\\n\\nwill, and sets friends to talking of things worth\\n\\nwhile.\\n\\n47\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nThe old man had been talking of mother and\\n\\nchildhood days, and ended by saying:\\n\\n&quot;This idea that childhood days are our very\\n\\nbest days is all foolishness and ought to be dis\\n\\ncarded. Children have just as many troubles and\\n\\ngriefs to the cubic inch as grown-ups have. All\\n\\nthe difference is, their difficulties are shorter-\\n\\nlived, also they have sense enough to run away\\n\\nfrom them sooner. The last days will be the\\n\\nbest days for every human being, who lives right,\\n\\nthinks right and acts right. I have been a careful\\n\\nstudent of human nature for fifty years. I know\\n\\nthe prosperity of wealth and the prosperity of\\n\\npoverty. I have tasted the adversity of wealth\\n\\nand the adversity of poverty. There are two\\n\\neternal, unchanging laws that work in and for\\n\\nevery human being, Compensation and Retri\\n\\nbution. Sometime, somewhere, some way, in this\\n\\nworld, retribution will overtake the man whose\\n\\n48\\n\\n\\n\\nHighfinger s Last Journey\\n\\nplan and purpose and deeds are evil. The wages\\n\\nof wrongdoing is death, and must, absolutely\\n\\nmust, separate from happiness here and now as\\n\\nwell as in eternity. Compensation will come to\\n\\nevery one whose plan, purpose and deeds are\\n\\nright. Life, sweet, refreshing, glorious, filled\\n\\nutterly full of joy, is the fruitage of years for\\n\\nevery man s best effort. And God has given to\\n\\nevery man to know when he has done his best.\\n\\nBy this I do not mean that any life shall be\\n\\nfree from mistakes, because judgment based on\\n\\nbrains is full of error. But judgment based on\\n\\nmotive is mighty near infallible. The Great\\n\\nGalilean pronounced a blessing for those who\\n\\nhunger and thirst for the right, and promised\\n\\nthey should be fed. The fateful thing in the\\n\\ntheory of fatalism is that wrongdoing does bring\\n\\nits own punishment. Insanity of heart is infinitely\\n\\nworse than insanity of head.\\n\\n49\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\n&quot;I promised you one day that I would tell you\\n\\nhow I lost the fingers of this hand, and I guess\\n\\nto-night is as good a time as will ever\\n\\n&quot;Ghost of Flanders! Soul of Satan! What s\\n\\nthat?&quot;\\n\\nBoth men sprang to their feet as a tongue of\\n\\nflame shot up from a rocky spur on the opposite\\n\\nslope, quickly followed by a second. Then both\\n\\nas quickly died, and only darkness reigned.\\n\\n&quot;Highfinger, what does that mean?&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Well, I guess it s the Yakis all right, and\\n\\nthe headlight of hell for us. Just wait a few\\n\\nminutes. If it is the Yakis, the summit of that\\n\\nsharp peak will flame shortly. Look, there it\\n\\ncomes now!&quot; And the flames rose twenty feet\\n\\nhigh, even as he spoke.\\n\\n&quot;Well, my boy, it s the same thing that hap\\n\\npened ten years ago; but I didn t have an aero\\n\\nplane then, and I sorter think we ll go over the\\n\\n50\\n\\n\\n\\nHighfinger s Last Journey\\n\\ntop with the Mystery Maid this time. It must\\n\\nbe close to midnight now, and we will just keep\\n\\nquiet till the moon comes up about two, then\\n\\nwe ll make the climb to the De Haviland and\\n\\nset her motors humming. I guess they ll have\\n\\nsome run for their gold, once we get the Maid\\n\\nwarmed up.&quot;\\n\\nWhen the sun hurled his chariots of flame\\n\\nacross the hills of Angustura, and bathed the\\n\\nsummits of Castile Leon with crimson glory,\\n\\nSaxon and Highfinger slipped through the man-\\n\\nzanite wall into the little park where the Maid\\n\\nreclined.\\n\\nQuickly dropping their bags of gold into the\\n\\npilot pit, Saxon laid his hand on the throttle,\\n\\nwhile more than fifty warriors rose from the\\n\\nvery shadows of her wings.\\n\\nWith an oath Highfinger pulled his automatic,\\n\\n51\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nbut Saxon knocked his hand upward and the shot\\n\\nwent wild far up the mountain.\\n\\n&quot;None of that, Old Tinier. I told you, when\\n\\nI agreed to come with you, there must be no\\n\\nbloodshed. I saw too much of that in Europe.\\n\\nI ll not stand for any of it here. Maybe we\\n\\ncan talk to these people, show them that ring\\n\\nand paper, and, if necessary, go with them to the\\n\\ncouncil chambers of the Iximaga. But we will\\n\\ngo with hands unstained by human blood. You\\n\\nsaid you wanted to start a revolution in Mexico,\\n\\nand I guess now is the time to start one of the\\n\\nbloodless brand.&quot;\\n\\nSaxon stepped out of the machine, faced the\\n\\nYaki leader and gave the Indian universal sign\\n\\nof friendship. Instantly every warrior responded\\n\\nwith hands uplifted high, and in faultless Eng\\n\\nlish the leader spoke.\\n\\n&quot;Brothers from the Northland, from whence\\n\\n52\\n\\n\\n\\nHighfinger s Last Journey\\n\\nour fathers came to till the fertile soil that\\n\\nslopes down to the friendly shores of the Aztec\\n\\nSea, we have a tradition from our fathers that\\n\\nsometime the House of Iximaga will be given a\\n\\nleader who will show how our treasures of gold\\n\\nmay be used for the good of all mankind. Until\\n\\nthat leader comes we must guard them well.\\n\\nWhen, seven days agone, we saw the white\\n\\nwings of this wondrous falcon bring you here,\\n\\nwe trusted you might be our messengers of hope\\n\\nand truth and love. Tell us now by what right\\n\\nyou attempt to carry off our gold? The ring\\n\\nwe know. It is from our prince, and we will\\n\\nhonor his long-delayed message. Come with us\\n\\nto the leaders of our people, the hogans of our\\n\\naged Iximaga of Truxlan, and whatever is right\\n\\nand fair between man and man we will do.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Highfinger, what do you say to that program?\\n\\nWhat will you do?&quot;\\n\\n53\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\n&quot;Well, I m civilized. I d go the way and do\\nthe things that civilization has done for a thou\\n\\nsand years. I d take some of that T. N. T. and\\n\\nblow these bronze beauties into the happy hunting\\n\\ngrounds and let them go on with their hunt,\\n\\nand I d head the Mystery Maid for good old\\n\\nU. S. A. The Force of Fight is my way, the\\n\\nway of all brains. But maybe the Force of\\n\\nFairness is better, the way of hearts. I ll go\\n\\nwith you wherever the Yakis lead, even unto\\n\\nthe hogans of Iximaga. Let us hit the trail.\\n\\nBut I don t want any snapshots of Highfinger\\n\\neating out of the hands of a Yaki.&quot;\\n\\nTullan singled out ten of the younger warriors,\\n\\nsaying: &quot;We will go by way of Hermosillo and\\n\\nthe Valley of the Oleanders. These others will\\n\\ngo by the shorter but rougher trail of Castile\\n\\nLeon, and prepare the way for our coming, so\\n\\nthere may be no delay when we arrive.&quot;\\n\\n54\\n\\n\\n\\nHighfinger s Last Journey\\n\\nWhen the sun hung low above the western sea,\\nTullan brought his band to a crystal spring\\n\\nwhere fragrance of balsam and juniper freighted\\n\\nthe air and luscious berries ripened neath giant\\n\\nferns.\\n\\nHighfinger s slumber was troubled with\\n\\ndreams, and several times Saxon caught one\\n\\nword, half spoken, half-breathed, &quot;Bessie.&quot;\\n\\nBy noontide the next day they dropped a thou\\n\\nsand feet through chaparral and manzanite to a\\n\\nsmall stream in a narrow valley, and camped\\n\\nfor the night by a white gravel-bottomed pool\\n\\nand refreshed their weary bodies with a plunge\\n\\nin the healing waters. After a supper of dried\\n\\nfruits, roasted grains, nuts and honey, Highfinger\\n\\nand Saxon sat on slabs of onyx and alabaster,\\n\\ndipping their feet in the laughing stream, while\\n\\nHighfinger told his life story.\\n\\n&quot;My real name is Ben Carson. I was born\\n\\n55\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nin old Virginny, far up on the head waters of the\\n\\nJames River, not far from Clifton Forge. My\\nfather was a well-to-do farmer, and my particular\\n\\nboyhood chum, Spot Black, was the son of a\\n\\nbanker in Glen Wilton. Spot was three years\\n\\nolder than I, and most of the time was a royal\\n\\ngood fellow, but had moods or seasons every year\\n\\nwhen he seemed possessed by the very devil of\\n\\nmischief that finally developed into viciousness.\\n\\nThe fascination of his deviltry and daring smoth\\n\\nered conscience, paralyzed will, and held me his\\n\\nchum even after my mother and my own judg\\nment warned me of disaster. When I was eigh\\n\\nteen, Spot went to Richmond, and I courted\\n\\nBessie Comvay, a beautiful, orphaned girl who\\n\\nclerked in Wilton s general store. I loved Bessie\\n\\nmore than everything else in all the world, except\\n\\nmyself, and she promised to be my wife. Mean\\n\\nwhile Spot wrote daily letters of such easy money\\n\\n56\\n\\n\\n\\nHighfinger s Last Journey\\n\\nand furious fun to be had in Richmond that 1\\n\\ndecided on a short visit with him, secretly in\\n\\ntending to remain there if easy money could come\\n\\nmy way. Spot feasted me at high-toned res\\n\\ntaurants with wines and champagne, and took me\\n\\nto luxurious rooms which I soon discovered was\\n\\na part of the Scarlet Way, and that Spot was\\n\\nits patron devil and ruling spirit. In a week I\\n\\nwas ruined, body, soul and spirit, racketing down\\n\\nthe hot pavements to the hell of a diseased body\\n\\nand corrupt mind. Returning to Glen Wilton,\\n\\nBessie and I were soon married, my father gave\\nus a beautiful cottage for a wedding present, I\\n\\nhad a good position, and we had almost two\\n\\nyears of heaven. Then our baby was born,\\n\\nblotched with disease and totally blind. A merci\\nful God spared Bessie from infection. Baby died,\\n\\nand we buried the little body in the old church\\n\\nyard at Glen Wilton. The day after the funeral\\n\\n57\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nI came home to luncheon a few minutes late.\\n\\nBessie, more beautiful than ever before, wore a\\n\\ndress that belonged to her courtship days. The\\n\\nbells of doom seemed sounding in my soul, and\\n\\nsomehow I knew the gates of living death and\\n\\ndeathless hell were wide open for me and I must\\n\\ngo in.\\n\\n&quot;After lunch, during which scarcely a word\\n\\nwas spoken, Bessie lifted her wondrous eyes to\\n\\nmine across the table, and, with infinite tenderness\\n\\nin her voice, she said: Mr. Carson, I have ac\\n\\ncepted my old place at the store and am going\\nto work there to-morrow. My trunk, with all\\nthat is mine, I have sent to my old room at\\n\\nMrs. -\\n,\\nwhere you courted me. Clothes and\\n\\nkeepsakes you gave me you will find in your\\n\\nbedroom. I m sure you will find all of them\\nthere. I dare not trust my soul and will not\\n\\ngive my body to a man who outrages every\\n58\\n\\n\\n\\nHighfinger s Last Journey\\n\\nattribute of womanhood and worse than murders\\n\\nhis own child before it is born. I have filed\\n\\ndivorce proceedings with the Ever-living God.\\n\\nWhen Judgment Day arrives and your case is\\n\\ncalled, I will meet you in His eternal Judgment\\n\\nHall and plead my own case. Until then we are\\n\\nstrangers.&quot;\\n\\nThat afternoon I sold the cottage and deposited\\n\\nthe money in the bank in her name. That\\n\\nevening I walked past Mrs. - s home, and\\n\\nthrough the window saw Bessie there, busy with\\n\\nsome fancy work as in the olden days when she\\n\\nawaited my coming. Then I took the night train\\n\\nfor Richmond, intending to kill Spot. Together\\n\\nthe next evening we drove out to a lonely road,\\n\\nand under the shadows of great trees I pulled\\n\\nmy gun; but the cap snapped, and Spot knocked\\n\\nme down with his own gun, bit off three fingers\\n\\nfrom my hand, beat me to insensibility, and left\\n\\n59\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nme to bleed to death. A passing stranger took\\nme to a hospital, where for weeks I raved in\\n\\ndelirium. Meanwhile Spot disappeared. Dis\\n\\nmissed from the hospital, I went to Leadville,\\n\\nColorado, hoping to find him in the haunts of\\n\\ncrime and sin there, but was disappointed. Then\\n\\nI turned to mining, and have chased the phantom\\n\\nof fortune ever since. Three years ago I returned\\n\\nto Glen Wilton for some days, and found Spot\\n\\nhad been there much of the time, but had left\\n\\na few days before I came, and I could get no\\n\\ntrace of where he had gone.\\n\\n&quot;Bessie was still there, a trained nurse, loved\\n\\nand honored above any other woman in Glen\\n\\nWilton, still vigorous and wondrously beautiful.\\n\\nI saw her often and tried to count the measure\\n\\nof happiness I might have had set over against\\n\\nthe cup of Damnation my sin had pressed to my\\n\\nlips for more than thirty years. No ene else\\n\\n60\\n\\n\\n\\nHighfinger s Last Journey\\n\\never recognized me, and, if she ever guessed who\\n\\nI \\\\vas, she gave no sign, and I came as I went,\\n\\na stranger and an outlaw in the land of my\\n\\nbirth. So much for the past. Now for the\\n\\nfuture.\\n\\n&quot;Last night my sleep was troubled. I had a\\n\\nhunch that my time has come. I wanted the\\n\\nhundred thousand for two reasons. First, I want\\n\\nto deposit fifty thousand dollars in Glen Wilton\\n\\nbank for Bessie, to insure comfort for her last\\n\\ndays. With the other fifty thousand I have\\n\\nplanned to search for Spot. If I live, I ll surely\\n\\nfind him. And, when I do, all the miseries and\\n\\nsorrows and punishments of hell will be delightful\\n\\npleasure compared with the grief and calamity\\n\\nI ll make him heir to. If something does happen\\n\\nto me to-morrow, as I believe, and these Yakis\\n\\never do let you go, the Mystery Maid and fifty\\n\\n61\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszotia\\n\\nthousand are yours; but you must attend to the\\n\\nfifty thousand for Bessie first.&quot;\\n\\nNext day noon found them camped in a grassy\\n\\nglen in the shadows of giant cliffs, where the\\n\\nHermosillo road crosses the little stream.\\n\\nWhile they rested and talked in Nature s pic\\n\\nturesque parlors, a woman s voice crying &quot;Ixi-\\n\\nmaga! Iximaga!&quot; pierced the air, and a fusillade\\n\\nof shots rattled beyond the turn of the road.\\n\\nA few moments later an Indian pony with gold-\\nmounted saddle and bridle dashed across the\\n\\nstream. Tullan caught the flying mustang,\\n\\nsnatched a woman s garment streaming from the\\n\\npommel, examined it for an instant, and shouted :\\n\\n&quot;The Princess Iximaga! For the Love of God,\\n\\nAmericanos, help!&quot;\\n\\nSaxon and Highfinger led the band around the\\n\\njagged rocks, where, huddled against a mighty\\n\\nboulder, were three women, while half a dozen\\n\\n62\\n\\n\\n\\nHighfinger s Last Journey\\n\\nYakis battled fiercely with twice as many Mexi\\n\\ncans, led by two white-skinned outlaws, one of\\n\\nwhom wore a mask.\\n\\n&quot;Ben Carson, your hour has come,&quot; shouted\\n\\nthe masked bandit as he hurled himself with\\n\\nterrific force upon Highfinger. The desperate\\n\\nattack sent Highfinger reeling backwards, but he\\n\\nparried the flashing blade and countered by a\\n\\ndownward thrust that cut the outlaw s left ear\\n\\nentirely off, and left a crimson streak far down\\n\\nhis breast. At the same time, with the long\\n\\nbony finger of his left hand, Highfinger pulled\\n\\nthe bandit s mask away, revealing the murderous\\n\\nface of Spot Black, livid with insane rage.\\n\\n&quot;Hurrah for Hell! Spot, you re almost there,&quot;\\n\\nshouted Highfinger, as his blade gouged Spot s\\n\\nleft eye out and sliced his nose and lips away.\\n\\nSpot s shirt was ripped to shreds, his long hair\\n\\nclotted with blood, his left arm sheared to the\\n\\n63\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nbone, still he lunged, desperately, blindly, on,\\n\\ntill a terrific downward blow plunged High-\\n\\nfinger s blade into his heart. As he fell forward\\n\\nin death, his knife severed Highfinger s jugular\\n\\nvein and sent him fiercely to the ground.\\n\\nSaxon lifted the old man s limp form and\\n\\ncarried it to the stream. As he bathed the ashen\\n\\nface, consciousness returned for a few moments,\\n\\na ghastly smile played around the bloodless lips\\n\\nas he whispered, &quot;We only need the fifty thou\\n\\nsand for Bessie now, for I have a hunch Spot\\n\\nhas met with a fatal accident.&quot;\\n\\nThen, without sound of wings or footfall, the\\n\\nold man slipped into the long trail whose far-\\n\\nflung heights await us all.\\n\\n64\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Road to Truxlan\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nTHE ROAD TO TRUXLAN\\n\\nWhen the morrow s sun flashed life and new\\n\\nborn hopes across a hemisphere and settled a mist\\n\\nof gold all o er Lastuna s hills, Saxon laid a\\n\\nwreath of that sweetest of all flowers, the desert\\n\\nrose, upon the new-made grave beneath the\\n\\noleanders, and with his hunting knife etched the\\n\\nold man s initials upon the granite cliff, then\\n\\nstanding, with face uplifted, in quiet strength\\n\\nlistened to the voice of the little stream as it\\n\\ndropped over a boulder reef, dimly wondering\\n\\nthe while what the day would bring and how\\n\\nhis strange adventure should end, now his old\\n\\nfriend gone and he must face the Yald chieftain\\n\\nalone.\\n\\nSuddenly a burst of wondrous music filled the\\n\\n65\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nglen, such music as comes once to every man s\\n\\nheart and sets his blood in waves pounding to\\n\\nthe very finger tips; such music as thrills the\\n\\nvery mystery of Heaven through his soul and\\n\\nbeckons his spirit to enchanted realms. A woman s\\n\\nvoice, clear, sweet, vibrant with overtones of\\n\\ngladness, led the sunrise song of the Yakis; and\\n\\nSaxon forgot he was a stranger in a strange land\\n\\nas he listened to that deep, full-throated song\\n\\nthrilling with exultant joy.\\n\\nAs the voice gained in volume and register\\n\\nand swelled in jubilant strains of the chorus to\\n\\ntriumphal close, Saxon felt some old order had\\n\\npassed away forevermore. All the yesterdays,\\n\\nwith their failure and heartache and struggle,\\n\\nand laughter and tears and gladness and despair,\\n\\nwere gone. A new day with a new chance, with\\nbetter hopes and sweeter dreams sure of being\\n\\nrealized, seemed pressing upon him, and the\\n\\n66\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Road to Truxlan\\n\\nwonder of life and living was so transcendently\\n\\nbeautiful, there could be nothing but rising tides\\n\\nto bear him to summerlands of the soul.\\n\\nAs the last note echoed in ineffable sweetness\\n\\nfrom the mighty walls of this &quot;Garden of God,&quot;\\n\\nthe messenger of Tullan summoned him to the\\n\\npresence of the Iximagan princess. With the\\n\\nspell of the voice still upon him, he followed the\\n\\nmessenger toward the tent of the women.\\n\\nThe tent that had served as a sleeping room\\n\\nfor the women was being taken down and pre\\n\\npared for the pack train. The larger tent still\\n\\nstood; but the sides were lifted, and a splendid\\n\\nbouquet of oleanders breathed subtle fragrance\\n\\neverywhere.\\n\\nTullan greeted him warmly, and with an air\\n\\nof expectant pride faced him toward a screen of\\n\\nheavy, bright-colored silk, brocaded with forms\\n\\nof birds, fruits and flowers. Only a moment\\n\\n67\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nthus, when a jewelled hand brushed aside the\\n\\nscreen, and the Princess stood beside Tullan.\\n\\nSurprised ! Well, possibly ; but the word does\\n\\nnot satisfy the condition.\\n\\nCertainly Saxon was, not a stranger to woman\\n\\nly beauty and feminine charm, for he had been\\n\\nfeted at brilliant receptions in Paris, London,\\n\\nNew York, Washington and New Orleans; but\\n\\nhere was the most entrancingly beautiful woman\\n\\nhe had ever seen.\\n\\nA trifle above average height, weighing perhaps\\na hundred and forty pounds; body well propor\\n\\ntioned; waving black hair fine as silk, in shining\\n\\nbraids coroneted to a faultless head; blue-black\\n\\neyes lustrous as molten gold; full, tender lips;\\n\\ncomplexion pink-bronze of health; cheeks with\\n\\nhint of dimples; perfect chin that rounded to a\\n\\nmatchless throat, swelling to a voluptuous bosom ;\\n\\ngrace incarnate in look and action; wide richly-\\n\\n68\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Road to Truxlan\\n\\ncolored sash at waist, with splendid reboso of\\n\\nwine-colored silk thrown over her shoulders, an\\n\\nuncrowned queen of original American blood,\\n\\njustly proud of the generations of ancestors who\\n\\nhad survived the most brutal persecutions the\\n\\nworld has ever known, and preserved kindness,\\n\\ngentleness and honor as the greatest heritage of\\n\\nher race, she stood before him, the Creator s\\n\\nmasterpiece of beauty and loveliness.\\n\\nAs only an Indian maiden can look, yea, al\\n\\nmost as God can look, beyond soul and sense,\\n\\nbrain and eye, into the heart and will, she gazed\\n\\nat Saxon more than a minute, her hands linked\\n\\nin friendship s sign, then smiling, spoke :\\n\\n&quot;Mr. Saxon, yestermorn you wrere an unwel\\n\\ncome stranger in Yaki land, but you and your\\n\\nfriend have saved more than my life; and now,\\n\\nwith all my heart I welcome you as guest of\\n\\nhonor to children of America s most ancient\\n\\n69\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\npeople, the Toltecs, whose highest national\\n\\nideal was peace, and whose greatest individual\\n\\nenrichment was kindness.\\n\\n&quot;You are perfectly free to return to your\\n\\nflying wonder on the mountain if you wish to\\n\\ndo so with all the gold you have taken; but you\\n\\ncan gladden my heart beyond measure if you\\nwill go with us to the home of my father, and\\n\\nlearn something of the spirit and purpose of my\\n\\npeople, small remnant of the once glorious\\n\\nIximagas.&quot;\\n\\nIn accord with centuries of Yaki custom,\\n\\nTullan led the way, while the Princess and Saxon\\n\\nrode side by side; and the way was a new way\\n\\nfor each of them, though the Princess had been\\n\\nover the road many times.\\n\\nThe southern end of the Hermosillo road\\n\\nbrought them over a soft, sand wash, bordered by\\n\\njagged hills and scant vegetation for some miles,\\n\\n70\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Road to Truxlan\\n\\nthen climbed by rugged grades to Cactus Mesa,\\n\\na broad savanna that stretched for a hundred\\n\\nmiles south by east, indescribably beautiful now\\n\\nwith bloom of desert rose and townships of\\n\\ngolden poppies.\\n\\nA few miles from the northen border of Cactus\\nFlat lies Oleander Valley, a narrow, winding\\n\\ngash in mother earth, with perpendicular walls\\n\\nof basalt and bed smooth as a floor, where\\n\\noleanders bloom under stately sycamores, and\\n\\nlinnets and wild canaries make music all the day.\\n\\nInto this valley they descended, and, turning\\n\\nto the left, journeyed all day long. When the\\n\\nafternoon shadows lengthened, they came to a\\n\\nlaughing spring that leaped from a perpendicular\\n\\ncliff to a great pool, but soon disappeared among\\n\\nbroken rocks. Here they camped for the night.\\n\\nWhen the setting sun flamed a trail of fire\\n\\nacross the Mother Sea and the afterglow kissed\\n\\n71\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nthe velvet sky into nameless beauty, the Princess\\n\\nand Saxon climbed a rugged trail to the rim of\\n\\nthe valley above the laughing waters, while the\\n\\npurple twilight breathed its magic charm over a\\n\\nlanguorous world and peopled the unbordered\\n\\ndistances with messengers divine.\\n\\n&quot;Whence came the Iximagas? May I know-\\n\\nsomewhat of the manner of their coming?&quot;\\n\\nTwas Saxon speaking, and his eyes, if you\\n\\ncould have come close to them, had a questioning,\\n\\nhungry look, as if the answer to his question had\\n\\npossibilities of life and death.\\n\\nThe question, so direct and compelling, startled\\n\\nthe Princess\\n; but, turning her wondrous eyes,\\n\\nnow full of friendly interest, full upon him, with\\n\\ninquiring gaze that seemed to say, &quot;You have\\n\\nasked a great deal, but I feel you can be trusted,&quot;\\n\\nshe said. &quot;Yes, I will show you the memory\\n\\ntablets of a once mighty race.\\n\\n72\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Road to Truxlan\\n\\n&quot;More than two thousand years ago my an\\n\\ncestors dwelt in a garden of delight, where the\\n\\nswift flowing Orontes sparkles through vine\\n\\nyards and orchards, drops through the giant\\n\\ncedars of Libanus, and flows through fertile\\n\\nfields where morning and evening the air is\\n\\nheavy with fragrance of myrtle trees spiced with\\n\\ntang of juniper and balm of Gilead, then winds\\n\\nits way through plains bespangled with rose of\\n\\nSharon and lilies of the valley, to pour its\\n\\ncrystal flood into the Great Sea. This homeland\\n\\nwas a pleasant land for centuries, and they were\\n\\nloath to leave it; but, weary of wars that de\\n\\nvastated lands and wasted cities, more than ten\\n\\nthousand young couples, with high resolve and\\n\\nstrong determination, set out to find a new land,\\n\\nsomewhere on God s great earth, where they\\n\\nmight plant a new civilization, based on Right\\n\\n73\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nand Justice, and maintain ideals of kindness,\\n\\ngentleness and truth.\\n\\n&quot;Towards the rising sun they traveled, over\\n\\nwasting sands, tremendous plateaus and match\\n\\nless lowlands, even unto the shores of the Mother\\n\\nSea. Then northward the star of hope led them\\n\\non to frozen lands, then eastward along a narrow\\n\\nstretch of barren plain by whose southern shore\\n\\nflowed a resistless flood of waters, warm from\\n\\ntropic seas, but whose northward shore was ice\\n\\nbound far as the eye could reach. Eastward\\n\\nthey came to an ever widening and uninhabited\\n\\nland of forests, filled with game and swift flow\\n\\ning streams that gave sense of security and home.\\n\\nTwelve times the moon waxed and waned, then\\n\\nfor days on days and still more days the earth\\n\\ngroaned and trembled, ocean tides boomed and\\n\\nthundered, high mountains sent forth tongues of\\n\\nflame, lowlands rose and fell, until nameless\\n\\n74\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Road to Truxlan\\n\\nterrors reigned everywhere and all things seemed\\n\\ndoomed to chaos. When Nature s travail was\\n\\nended, the bridge of land they had crossed was\\n\\nbroken into islands, and return, even if desired,\\n\\nwas impossible. Our God had given us a new\\n\\nland, and no enemy was there to make war; and\\n\\nhighest hopes and better days filled every heart,\\n\\nas our people journeyed southward.\\n\\n&quot;In the lands from whence you come, Ari\\n\\nzona, you call it, but known to our people as\\n\\nthe Sunshine Parlors of the Great Spirit, my\\n\\npeople digged water-ways, created gardens of\\n\\nfruit and flowers and grains, with homes of\\n\\nplenty. Oleanders bloomed, pomegranates rip\\n\\nened, peace and contentment ruled, and the Ixi-\\n\\nmagas became a mighty people. Grown to mil\\n\\nlions, colonies were planted south and eastward\\n\\non the shores of the great bay. Ever southward\\n\\nour civilization streamed, growing in splendor\\n\\n75\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nand power, until luxurious ease and idleness\\n\\nbecame the ruling passion and a mania for\\n\\npleasure coursed through brain and body, and\\n\\nGod, our God, who had blest us beyond our\\n\\nwildest dreams, was forgotten. The form and\\n\\nceremonies of godliness crowded our temples and\\n\\nenriched her altars, but the spirit of brotherhood\\n\\nhad departed and our glory was gone.\\n\\n&quot;Then came the scourge of desolation, the\\n\\nAztecs, offspring of scythian witches and Tartar\\n\\noutlaws, the Huns of America. How they\\ncame only the Great Spirit knows, but they fell\\n\\nupon all that our hands and brains and skill had\\n\\nwrought. Cunning as spiders, fierce as demons,\\n\\nthey drove us from our cities, seized our farms,\\n\\nset up altars for sacrifice of blood to their gods\\n\\nof war, and my people fled across the Cordilleras\\n\\nto the valleys and mesas of this great land.\\n\\nMeanwhile pestilence, famine and earthquake\\n\\n76\\n\\n\\n\\nhad brought desolation to northern lands, and the\\n\\nremnant of our people there joined us here, and\\n\\nagain peace and plenty beckoned us on.\\n\\n&quot;That was seven hundred years ago. Where\\n\\nyour airship now rests was then a splendid lake.\\n\\nThis cactus covered mesa was a wide spreading\\n\\nwheatfield, sloping down to the arms of the\\n\\nToltec gulf, which was much wider then and\\n\\nextended a hundred miles farther north.\\n\\n&quot;A hundred years rolled swiftly by in Old\\n\\nMescal. Our architects were busy with plans\\n\\nfor great temples of worship, plazas of peace and\\n\\npleasure, and pyramids for our dead. Abundant\\n\\nharvests were gathered, and great fiestas of glad\\n\\nness were on all over the nation. Then far to\\n\\nthe north and west Sunset Mountain shot forth\\n\\nhissing flames a thousand feet high. A heavy\\nstream of black oil burst from the mountain s\\n\\nbase and overspread the entire inland sea. There\\n\\n77\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nwere thunderings, lightnings and an earthquake;\\n\\nthe oil caught fire; a barrage of flame rolled in\\n\\ntremendous cascades down to the very gates of\\n\\nthe Mother Sea. This mountain, Castile Leon,\\n\\nbelched smoke and lava; the lowlands along the\\n\\ncoast were lifted up ; our wheat fields were baked,\\n\\nour lake drained by underground channels.\\n\\nThousands of our people perished from hunger,\\n\\nfear and black plague, and the remnant sought\\n\\nrefuge in the vales of Truxlan. Then the\\n\\nSpaniards came, broke the Aztec power, and the\\n\\nToltecs had some measure of freedom and peace.\\n\\nNow courage and hope is strong as in the olden\\n\\ndays in the hogans of the Yakis, and the House\\n\\nof Iximaga believes the long dark night of\\n\\nhumiliation will soon be ended and the dawn of\\n\\na better day is at hand, a day when the foolish,\\n\\ncruel rule of this hybrid nation Spaniard and\\n\\nAztec will be broken, and a wise and just\\n\\n78\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Road to Truxlan\\n\\ncivilization worthy of this generous, genial sunny\\n\\nclime, will hold lasting sway from Rio Grande\\n\\nto Yucatan and from the Mayan gulf to the\\n\\nMother Sea.&quot;\\n\\nInspired by the splendor and sweep of the\\n\\ndeathless passion of her people for highest ideals,\\n\\nand thrilled with hope of speedy consummation\\n\\nof immortal dreams, the fair Iximagan seemed\\n\\ntransformed and radiant with spiritual power\\n\\nand loveliness.\\n\\nIn the morning she had appeared to Saxon\\n\\ntranscendently beautiful. Now in the deeps of\\nhis soul, every vestige of racial prejudice swept\\n\\naway, he knew that of all women she was the\\n\\nonly one who, walking by his side, could make\\n\\nhis life s pathway luminous with joy forevermore.\\n\\nA tiny thread of flame shot up from the camp\\nunder the sycamores far below, and one of the\\n\\ntents glowed from lighted candles within.\\n\\n79\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\n&quot;Look,&quot;\\nsaid the Princess. &quot;Tullan has\\n\\nkindled our watch-fires, and Vestal and Cas\\n\\nsandra are chanting the Toltec vesper hymn.\\n\\n&quot;Come, let us go.&quot;\\n\\n80\\n\\n\\n\\nSaxon Meets Iximaga\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nSAXON MEETS IXIMAGA\\n\\nAscending from the Valley of Oleanders the\\n\\nfollowing morning, Tullan led them across a\\n\\nheavy lava flow to a narrow ridge, or headland,\\n\\nthat commanded a perfect view of the Valley\\n\\nof the Yakis, the Vale of Tuxlan and the hogans\\n\\nof Iximaga two thousand feet below and more\\n\\nthan twenty miles away. Eastward were low\\n\\nhills and wooded slopes.\\n\\nThe valley itself lies in the form of a tre\\n\\nmendous quadrangle. Across the northern end\\n\\nwere three cities ; in the center of the valley stood\\n\\nthe capitol of the tribe, with the gleaming white\\n\\nhogans of Iximaga in bold relief; while across\\n\\nthe southern end, terraced to the very base of\\n\\nperpendicular, phonolite cliffs, lay six villages\\n\\n81\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nwith scores of towers gleaming like burnished\\n\\nsilver.\\n\\nAs Saxon, with the trained eye of the aviator,\\n\\nsurveyed the marvelous panorama, he caught the\\n\\nimpression of a magnificent temple, the coloring\\n\\nof the cliffs at the extreme southern end, with\\n\\nthe checker-board of villages at the base, lending\\n\\nthe effect of a tremendous pipe organ. Already\\n\\nthe valley was astir writh human life. From\\n\\nnorth and south long lines were forming and\\n\\nmoving toward the center of the western side,\\n\\nwhere the road dropped from the broad shoulders\\n\\nof Castile Leon to the far-spreading lowlands,\\n\\nthen ran straight as a line of light to the hogans\\n\\nof Iximaga. Along this road the lines of wel\\n\\ncome were forming to receive the Princess and\\n\\nher rescuer, the messenger of the white-winged\\n\\nfalcon of the skies.\\n\\n&quot;Let us wait a little season,&quot; said the Princess,\\n\\n82\\n\\n\\n\\nSaxon Meets Ixiiuaga\\n\\nTis such a morning as I have seen the mirage\\n\\nwork wonders, and I wish you might view our\\n\\nhomeland under the charm of its creative magic.&quot;\\n\\nScarcely had she finished speaking when the\\n\\nviewless hands of this miracle worker began to\\n\\nweave form and color across the northern end\\n\\nof the valley. Steel-blue towers with girders,\\n\\nbands, trusses and Alhambran arches climbed in\\n\\nrich profusion to dizzy heights. Homes, business\\n\\nblocks, temples, forums, plazas, market places,\\n\\ndomes, turrets, spires, altars, pyramids, rose in\\n\\nsplendid proportions, until the entire valley was\\n\\nteeming with all the life, splendor and artificial\\n\\narchitecture of the great engineers of America s\\n\\nancient empire builders, and the glories and\\n\\nwonders of a mighty civilization was filmed upon\\n\\nthe wide-flung greens and terraces of the land of\\n\\nthe Manziyumas. Then the continental divide\\n\\nfar beyond seemed to dissolve and melt away into\\n\\n83\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nthe lowlands that sloped down to the sparkling\\n\\nwaters of the Mayan Gulf, and the vast domain\\n\\nof prehistoric realms took form and position, with\\n\\norchards, vineyards, maize-fields, forests, lakes,\\n\\nrivers, cities and the multitudinous life of peace\\n\\nful millions.\\n\\nOnce again the slides were changed in this\\n\\ncamera of the ages, and the forces of destruction\\n\\nin entrancing but appalling pantomime played\\n\\nupon the screen, mailed warriors, swift footmen,\\n\\nvast armies in fighting formation, battle-axes,\\n\\nand spears, lances and bludgeons, battling rams\\n\\nand catapults, rivers of blood, sheets of flame,\\n\\nburning cities, blazing temples, devastated homes,\\n\\nwomen and children trodden down or fleeing\\ntoward the western hills, famine, pestilence, war,\\n\\nwar, war, hell on every side, a vast cauldron\\n\\nof doom, boiling, swirling everywhere; Aztec,\\n\\nMoundbuilder, Mayan, Tezcucan, Peruvian co-\\n\\n84\\n\\n\\n\\nSaxon Aleets Ixiinaga\\n\\nhorts, Inca leading on, Montezuma s battalion\\n\\nlegions charging down the steeps, an irresistible\\n\\navalanche of destruction. Then the Spaniards\\n\\ncame to complete the desolation with his greed\\n\\nfor gold.\\n\\nAs the mirage vanished, Saxon turned to his\\n\\ncompanion. &quot;Fair Iximagan, you have your wish.\\n\\nMine eyes have seen the glory of your people\\n\\nand their desolation. I, too, believe their former\\n\\ngreatness must be restored. Surely the sufferings\\n\\nand calamities, past and present, of this Garden\\n\\nof God have not been altogether in vain, and\\n\\nwith return of former ideals must come a golden\\n\\nage of a race redeemed, with another chance to\\n\\nwork out blessings for a world.&quot;\\n\\nThe lustrous eyes of the fair Iximagan were\\n\\nwondrously full of happiness, as she replied : &quot;Call\\n\\nme not Fair Princess, call me Dalleszona ; for\\n\\n85\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nthus I am known to friends, and you are more\\n\\nthan friend.&quot;\\n\\nDropping through vast reaches of purple sage\\n\\ninto a winding canyon, Tullan led them through\\n\\na narrow defile, whence they suddenly emerged\\n\\ninto the Gardens of Castile Leon, with its laugh\\n\\ning fountains, singing birds and grateful shade.\\n\\nAfter light refreshments were served, while\\n\\nthe rest of the weary travelers laughed, chatted,\\n\\nand listened to the restful merrymaking of the\\n\\nfeathered songsters, Dalleszona led Saxon to the\\n\\nbase of a precipitous bluff where a half-naked\\n\\nYaki kept watchful guard near a heavy screen\\n\\nof bougainvillaea. At a sign from Dalleszona the\\n\\nguard passed under the blooming mass and rolled\\n\\naside a heavy stone door. Passing the threshold,\\n\\nthe door rolled into place, and Saxon and the\\n\\ngirl were left alone in a dimly lighted corridor,\\n\\nwith walls of solid granite.\\n\\n86\\n\\n\\n\\nSaxon Uleets Iximaga\\n\\nSaxon s nerves were tense as drawn steel\\n\\ncords, for he had just listened to the story of\\n\\nthe final desperate stand of the Toltecs against\\n\\nthe Aztecs in this place long centuries agone,\\n\\nand how, four hundred years before, the Span\\n\\niards had murdered hundreds of men, women\\n\\nand children in this old garden in an attempt\\n\\nto extort more gold and the location of their\\n\\ntreasure from them. However, he took the candle\\n\\nfrom her hand and followed her along the cor\\n\\nridor, until they arrived at another circular stone\\n\\ndoor, and somehow his mind called up the\\n\\nshriveled mummies in the gold-lined cave on the\\n\\nother side of the mountain. Upon request of\\n\\nDalleszona, Saxon rolled the door aside, revealing\\n\\nutter darkness. Stepping inside, again the door\\n\\nrolled into place, and with difficulty he refrained\\n\\nfrom screaming aloud. The girl touched the\\n\\ncandle to a torch that instantly flamed, lighting\\n\\n87\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nup a great natural cave, the roof and sides fretted\\n\\nwith gleaming crystals in fantastic forms, while\\n\\nhalf-sitting, half-reclining on gypsum benches\\n\\nwere scores of the illustrious dead of the Ixi-\\n\\nmagas, the beauty and chivalry of the Toltecs\\n\\nfor two thousand years; Humanity s last pitiful\\n\\neffort to abolish death; Mortality s voiceless cry\\n\\nfor immortality. Down the long aisle Dalleszona\\n\\nled the way, the dust of ages, white, soft, and\\n\\nfine as flour under their feet, gave no sound\\n\\nsave the muffled breathings as of souls crossing\\n\\n&quot;No Man s Land&quot; to eternal realms, until they\\ncame to another stone door. All of Saxon s\\n\\nstrength was required to roll it in the grooves;\\n\\nbut, once inside, he stood transfixed, amazed at\\n\\nwhat he saw. Brilliant white light flooded\\n\\neverywhere, falling in dazzling splendor upon\\n\\nlong rows of tables, benches and sideboards of\\n\\nalabaster and onyx, reflected from prisms of pure\\n\\n88\\n\\n\\n\\nSaxon Meets Iximaga\\n\\nobsidian, sparkling on globes and shafts of chal\\n\\ncedony, and far down the splendid length shim\\n\\nmering in lustrous waves from matchless tapes\\n\\ntries of silken wool, and maguey fibre white as\\n\\nthe garments of righteousness in the apocalyptic\\n\\nvision.\\n\\nUpon the benches and tables were all manner\\n\\nof copper tools, also rings, brooches, bracelets\\n\\nand other ornaments of silver and gold, inlaid\\n\\nwith priceless gems in myriad shapes and beauty;\\n\\nbronze tablets and copper shields side by side of\\n\\nslabs of silver and gold, engraved with the history\\n\\nand achievements of a great people for thousands\\n\\nof years ; also brocaded curtains and screens, with\\n\\nforms of birds, animals, flowers, fruits, grasses\\n\\nand grains and trees in endless variety; medal\\n\\nlions, plaques, busts and bas-reliefs of both men\\n\\nand women, immortal genii of a proud race\\n\\n89\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nwrought into metallic beauty, untarnished by the\\n\\ncorroding hand of Time.\\n\\nThe thing that impressed Saxon most was the\\n\\nutter absence of anything, or instrument, for\\n\\ndestruction, nothing to kill or maim or wound,\\n\\nno relic of war of any kind, but everything to\\n\\ncreate, build up and make beautiful.\\n\\nEntranced, Saxon forgot time and outside\\n\\nthings, and would have spent days and weeks\\n\\nseeing and studying things, but Dalleszona called\\n\\nhim away.\\n\\n&quot;Some day we will return, and you may see\\n\\nand learn all you wish of these, for I want you\\n\\nto know that we have not always been a broken\\n\\nhearted, humiliated, almost hopeless people ; but\\n\\nnow our escort is waiting. Tullan will be re\\n\\nquired to report, and present you to my father\\n\\nsoon. Besides, I know you will be interested in\\n\\n90\\n\\n\\n\\nSaxon Elects Iximngn\\n\\nmany things along the white way to which we\\n\\nmust now be going.&quot;\\n\\nAs they turned into the &quot;Sunbeam Road,&quot;\\n\\nDalleszona was in happy, brilliant mood, and the\\n\\nlife-giving contagion of her splendid presence\\n\\ninspired the whole party to laughter and song.\\n\\nSaxon joined as far as possible in all the gayety;\\n\\nbut above the cheer and charm of the wondrous\\n\\nwelcome a mighty struggle swept his spirit.\\n\\nEven as aero-squadrons massed in battle-formation\\n\\nabove peaceful fields and silent woods, so the\\n\\nimmortal forces of the world s spiritual ideals\\n\\ncharged in bloodless contest gainst prejudice,\\n\\nprecedent and propriety. It was the age-old,\\n\\nworld-wide battle of love for a wonderful woman\\n\\nin the heart of a man with hate of people,\\n\\ncustoms and things different from what he had\\n\\nbeen accustomed to see and know.\\n\\nAs they neared the capitol grounds, the throngs\\n\\n91\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nincreased to tens of thousands; for the Yakis had\\n\\nbeen summoned from every nook and corner of\\n\\nToltec lands, and the significance of the whole\\n\\ngathering burst upon him with overwhelming\\n\\npower. It was not only a welcome for their\\n\\nprincess, it was also a demonstration of the past\\n\\nand a prophecy of the future. It was two thou\\n\\nsand years of history writ into life. It was a\\n\\nnation s horoscope for centuries, Yakis, half-\\n\\nnaked, filthy, despairing, broken as they had been\\n\\nfor four hundred years ; Yakis with mortal terror\\n\\nin face and eyes as they fled from the flaming\\n\\ndeath of Aztecs; Toltecs, strong, proud, hopeful,\\n\\nwell clothed, peace, plenty, power, passion, pleas\\n\\nure, poverty, with here and there in every group\\n\\nfaces of high resolve, eyes agleam with lofty\\n\\nideals and unmeasured purpose, the flower and\\n\\nfruitage, sweetness and greatness of two millen\\n\\nniums of mortal endeavor. Sunlight and shadow,\\n\\n92\\n\\n\\n\\nSaxon Meets Iximaga\\n\\njoy and sorrow, laughter and crying, hosannas\\n\\nand curses, a photograph of long, long centuries\\n\\nof a nation s life staged in human flesh, fire and\\n\\naction.\\n\\nAs Saxon watched and sensed the whole pag\\n\\neant, he wished as only a lover can wish, that\\n\\nDalleszona might see the mighty gatherings of\\n\\nhis fellow-countrymen in the United States and\\n\\ncatch the sweep and vision of their institutions\\n\\nand progress.\\n\\nAs they approached the hogans of Iximaga,\\n\\nDalleszona dismounted and, with flying feet,\\n\\npassed to the inner court, while Tullan led\\n\\nSaxon to a grape-vined pergola beside a silvery\\n\\nfountain.\\n\\nIn half an hour Dalleszona came with her\\n\\nfather and mother, leaders of a nation. A\\n\\nsingle glance compelled Saxon to admit to himself\\n\\nhe was in the presence of true greatness, the\\n\\n93\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nmother, sweet-faced, with the tender questioning\\n\\neyes of her people; the father, seventy years of\\n\\nage, with the form and vigor of fifty, full six\\n\\nfeet tall, broad shouldered, deep chested, clean\\n\\nlimbed, massive head domed high in front, lu\\n\\nminous but kindly eyes. In all the gatherings\\n\\nof Europe Saxon had never seen the superior of\\n\\nthis commanding American.\\n\\n&quot;My son, welcome to the land of the Toltecs,\\n\\nthe hogans of Iximaga, the heart of a once great\\n\\nand still generous race. You must be weary with\\n\\nlong hours in the saddle. Come, we will have\\n\\nrefreshments.&quot;\\n\\nThe dining-room was narrow, but long. An\\n\\nalabaster slab on a heavy pedestal of chalcedony\\n\\nserved as table. The seats were rustic, of man-\\n\\nzanite and chaparral. All dishes ^were glazed\\n\\npottery, save some bowls of woven work for\\n\\nfruit and nuts; but the knives, forks and spoons\\n\\n94\\n\\n\\n\\nSaxon fleets Iximaga\\n\\nwere of solid silver, hand wrought and finely en\\n\\ngraved. Several bronze medallions of famous\\n\\nancestors decorated the walls; but the thing that\\n\\nattracted Saxon s close attention was a matchless\\n\\npiece of tapestry, which served as a screen and\\n\\ncurtain at the far end, next to a sleeping room\\n\\nwhere he was later taken. Seeing his eyes often\\n\\nturned to the tapestry, Dalleszona said : &quot;Come,\\n\\nI will show you the work of my brother whom\\n\\nyour friend Highfinger buried in Lastuna Hills.&quot;\\n\\nTo his utter surprise it was not tapestry at all,\\nbut a massive slab of snow white obsidian, inlaid\\n\\nwith a filigree of gold in network design. The\\n\\nreverse side was painted with mineral indigo\\n\\nextracted from metallic ores by chemical pro\\n\\ncesses, so true to nature s coloring that the whole\\n\\npiece seemed a section of real sky flecked with\\n\\npatches of cloud whose edges were tinged with\\n\\nfire. As he studied this unmatched creation, let\\n\\n95\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nit be set down to his eternal credit that Ben Saxon\\n\\nwas large enough to pay sincere homage to the\\n\\ngenius of this unsung American, now sleeping in\\n\\nan unknown grave in the desert sage.\\n\\nWhen the voiceless magic of semi-tropical\\n\\nnight breathed all subtle charms across this land\\n\\nof legend and romance with its crumbling towers\\n\\nand vine-covered walls, and the stars came out\\n\\nin a low-arched sky blue as molten sapphires,\\n\\nthese two young people sat together near a low-\\n\\nvoiced fountain, and Dalleszona thrummed sweet\\n\\nunnamed melodies of her ancient race from a\\n\\nrnaitreown, and gave to Saxon the legends of the\\n\\nIncas before Pizzaro came.\\n\\nWhen Dalleszona bade him good-night, he\\n\\npassed to his own room; but ere he disrobed for\\n\\nthe night he had distinct remembrance of three\\n\\nthings of vital importance for all coming days.\\n\\nHe had promised Iximaga that he would bring\\n96\\n\\n\\n\\nSaxoti JMeets Iximaga\\n\\nthe Mystery Maid to Truxlan; Dalleszona had\\n\\npromised to joyride \\\\vith him in the airplane;\\n\\nand he had resolved to but I guess he would\\n\\nnot want me to write that now.\\n\\n97\\n\\n\\n\\nDaUeszona\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nAx INTERPRETER OF DREAMS\\n\\nThe next morning Saxon and Tullan went\\n\\nafter the Mystery Maid, taking the shorter,\\n\\nrugged trail across the shoulder of Castile Leon.\\n\\nTullan led the way, wary, but silent, after the\\n\\nfashion of his people. Saxon was busy trying to\\n\\nplan a future with DaUeszona, but finding no\\n\\nway to get her out of the land of her nativity, or\\n\\nseparate her from her people.\\n\\nTullan was a splendid fellow. Iximaga was\\n\\nworthy of ajl respect and admiration. DaUeszona\\n\\nwas perfect, with new and wonderful charms\\n\\ncoming to light in unexpected ways. But her\\n\\npeople! Bizmillah! In truth, most of them\\n\\nwere a filthy, mangy, hopeless bunch. How could\\nhe ever come to recognize them as equals, asso-\\n\\n98\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Interpreter of Dreams\\n\\nciates, friends, brothers, family relatives. Then\\n\\nthere would come the flash-vision of Toltec\\n\\ngreatness and real grandeur in bygone ages, as\\n\\nproved by the historic treasures he had seen in\\n\\nthe art gallery in the old garden, and with it\\n\\nDalleszona s faith-dream of restoration. And\\n\\nSaxon was forced to admit the dream might be\\n\\nrealized under proper leadership, and also that\\n\\nthe leader of such an accomplishment would reap\\n\\nthe largest harvest of personal satisfaction and\\n\\ninsure to himself the largest possible measure of\\n\\nworldly honors, and possibly become the stabilizing\\n\\nfactor that should save civilization from the\\n\\nsweep of unrest and impending chaos which might\\n\\nprecede the reconstruction of nations emerging\\n\\nfrom the wreckage of the Great War, because he\\n\\ncould clearly see it would be far more difficult\\n\\nto secure united effort of people for rebuilding\\n\\nthe world s fortunes than it was to inspire them\\n\\n99\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nfor war. And beyond this. How could he go\\naway and ever be happy, remembering this beau\\n\\ntiful, talented girl, held in the bond of race,\\n\\nworking steadfastly on to certain failure and\\n\\ninfinite sorrow if no efficient leader appeared for\\n\\nher people. Of course he could return to the\\n\\nUnited States with the fifty thousand dollars for\\n\\na start, and after the fashion of his people he\\n\\ncould probably accumulate vast wealth ; but he\\n\\nhad already seen enough of the world to know\\n\\nthat, while money could buy many comforts,\\n\\nwealth was absolutely powerless to buy happiness\\n\\nof heart or satisfy the craving of love.\\n\\nThus he battled with this personal problem as\\n\\nhe fled along the trail behind the swift-footed\\n\\nTullan. One moment, hot with wrath with\\n\\nhimself for ever listening to Highfinger s dreams,\\n\\nthen thankful and glad as he recalled the de\\n\\nliverance he had helped to give to Dalleszona.\\n\\n100\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Interpreter of Dreams\\n\\nFinally he fell to wondering what Iximaga had\\n\\nin mind when he said he wanted to talk business.\\n\\nWas it possible Iximaga would offer to him the\\n\\nwork of restoring the Toltec nation? But even\\n\\nthis alluring prospect was soon banished from\\n\\nhis mind.\\n\\nThe trail they had followed up the long ridges\\n\\nnow led them into a small glen. Skirting a small\\n\\nclear lake they came upon the ruins of a mag\\n\\nnificent temple facing the lake. Immediately to\\n\\nthe rear of the ruins lay a small crescent of land\\n\\nentirely flanked by a natural amphitheatre suf\\n\\nficient to seat many thousands of people. In fact,\\n\\nthe place had been a national forum for the\\n\\nToltecs in the age of their splendor and power,\\n\\nand had been dismantled by the Aztecs centuries\\n\\nbefore.\\n\\nFor an hour Saxon wandered around this\\n\\nfascinating ruin, but never dreamed of the tre-\\n\\n101\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nmendous influence this place would have upon\\n\\nhis own and the world s future. But the pos\\n\\nsibilities of its restoration occupied his thoughts\\n\\nuntil they reached the De Haviland.\\n\\nFor the return trip they sailed due east along\\n\\nthe northern line of Yaki land for many miles,\\n\\nfinally landing at Southrown, where waters of\\n\\nmineral springs flowed into spacious granite tanks,\\n\\nand refreshed themselves with bathing in the\\n\\nhealing waters. But the thing that interested\\n\\nSaxon most was several heavy springs of high-\\n\\ngrade petroleum in a vast basin not far from the\\n\\nhot springs, and could be easily turned into com\\n\\nmercial fortune.\\n\\nThat evening Iximaga very carefully examined\\n\\nthe mechanism of the Mystery Maid, and asked\\n\\nmany questions as to cost of manufacture and\\n\\npossibilities of service.\\n\\nThe next day Dalleszona and Saxon sailed\\n\\n102\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Interpreter of Dreams\\n\\nsouthward, and landed near the base of the cliffs\\n\\nhe had seen so marvellously outlined by the\\n\\nmirage. For several hours they explored the\\n\\nquarries of onyx and alabaster, also the gem\\n\\nmines where beryl, chalcedony, tourmaline and\\n\\nrubies, amethyst and emerald, obsidian and tur\\n\\nquoise veined with wire gold lay in rich abun\\n\\ndance through immense ledges. Here were pre\\n\\ncious stones sufficient to enrich a world beside\\n\\nwhich all the accumulated jewels of Europe and\\n\\nOriental royal courts paled to insignificance.\\n\\nWhen the afternoon shadows lengthened, the\\n\\nDe Haviland soared above the cliffs and once\\n\\nmore headed southward. For miles they hovered\\n\\nover a winding, rocky chasm which finally\\n\\nemerged into a far-reaching valley, enriched with\\n\\norchard, vineyard and meadow lands, a land\\n\\nthat for two hundred and fifty years had been\\n\\nheld by the Yakis under grant from Spain, but\\n\\n103\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nunder the rule of Diaz s covetous eyes had been\\n\\nfastened upon it, and thousands upon thousands\\n\\nof the fairest and best of Yaki sons and daugh\\n\\nters had been and were still being sold into\\n\\nslavery by the Mexican government, to wear\\n\\ntheir lives away in the sisal hemp fields of Yu\\n\\ncatan, whence comes the binder twine for the\\n\\nharvest fields of U. S. A.\\n\\nWith streaming eyes Dalleszona told of the\\n\\ndespoiling of homes, breaking up of families and\\n\\nconfiscation of lands of her people, and finally\\n\\nasked : &quot;Oh, Mr. Saxon, why can t your great\\n\\npeople and mighty government that went across\\n\\nthe seas to right humanity s wrongs in Europe,\\n\\nOh, why can t they put an end to human slavery\\n\\nin this fair land? Oh, can t you find some way\\n\\nto break the spell of darkness that still hangs\\n\\nthreatening above the pathway of the Toltecs\\n\\n104\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Interpreter of Dreams\\n\\nand paralyzes the very fountains of ambition for\\n\\nmy people?&quot;\\n\\nOf course Saxon could not pledge anything\\nfor his great nation, but solemnly, sublimely,\\n\\nirrevocably he pledged his own life and effort to\\n\\nanswer the appeal of this uncrowned queen of\\n\\nAmerica.\\n\\nThe next day, and for many days, Saxon and\\n\\nIximaga passed m&ny hours together in the\\n\\ncouncil chamber of the Yakis, and made several\\n\\ntrips to the cave of art and history treasures\\n\\nwhich Dalleszona had opened for him in the\\n\\n&quot;Garden of Castile Leon.&quot;\\n\\nUndoubtedly many, many questions of absorb\\n\\ning interest were discussed, but only two things\\n\\nbecame surely known. First, Saxon s parentage\\n\\nand ancestral history, as far as known to himself,\\n\\nwere freely and fully given to Iximaga. Second,\\n\\nIximaga offered Saxon a salary of one thousand\\n\\n105\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nounces of gold per year for five years to become\\n\\nthe governmental agent and business manager of\\n\\nhis people, henceforth to be known as &quot;The\\n\\nToltec Nation.&quot;\\n\\nAfter a couple of weeks, during which Saxon\\n\\nfulfilled his pledge to Highfinger, he returned to\\n\\nTruxlan and undertook the most stupendous\\n\\ntask of modern times ; namely, the restoration\\n\\nof a race to a rightful place among nations; the\\n\\nredemption of a vast geographical domain from\\n\\nthe hand of chronic failure ; and, finally, though\\n\\nhe knew it not then, the inspiration of a world\\n\\nto deathless loyalty to a winning democracy.\\n\\nThe very day of his return, Dalleszona brought\\n\\nto him the national flag of the Toltecs, a mag\\n\\nnificent creation of silk, wool and maguey fibre,\\n\\nfrom their ancient looms, preserved through all\\n\\nthe centuries of Aztec and Spanish desolation, by\\n\\n106\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Interpreter of Dreams\\n\\nIximagan devotion, loyalty and sacrifice, even\\n\\nunto death.\\n\\nThe colors were : the velvet blue of semi-\\n\\ntropical skies, emblematic of God s protection and\\n\\na nation s trust and acknowledgment of Him; a\\n\\nbroad band of white speaking for peace and\\n\\nfriendship to all through the center; the lower\\n\\nportion was perfect orange, token of resplendent\\n\\ndawn of Hope and Progress.\\n\\nAs its generous folds floated upon the breeze,\\n\\nand fluttered a thing of life above the vine-\\n\\nwreathed hogans of Iximaga, shouts of joy and\\n\\nsurprise broke forth all over the village. It was\\n\\nthe first friendly flag many of them had ever seen,\\n\\nand but few knew of its existence or what it\\n\\nstood for; but every one knew it stood for some\\n\\nchange, so, wider, farther, louder swelled the cry,\\n\\nuntil thousands filled the plaza and blocked the\\n\\nstreets. Briefly, Iximaga spoke to them of the\\n\\n107\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\npast and present, and what the flag meant to\\n\\nthem for the future. From lip to lip and heart\\n\\nto heart the joyful message was carried on, until\\n\\nSaxon s blood tingled as when he had led his\\n\\naero-squadrons in fighting formation above the\\n\\npoppies of Flander s field, and felt that at last\\n\\nhe understood that immortal line, &quot;Mine eyes\\n\\nhave seen the glory of the coming of the Lord,&quot;\\n\\nand sensed the power and spirit of an Ideal\\n\\nto disenthrall a world, as,\\n\\n&quot;All day long that free flag tossed\\n\\nOver the heads of that Toltec host.\\n\\nEver its bright folds rose and fell\\n\\nO er loyal hearts that loved it well :\\nTill through the hill-gaps sunset light\\n\\nShone over it with a warm good-night.&quot;\\n\\nSaxon knew it was one thing to create en-\\n\\n108\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Interpreter of Dreams\\n\\nthusiasm by raising a flag, but a very different\\n\\nthing to inspire a nation to live in steadfast\\n\\ncourage and loyalty to the lofty ideals that flag\\n\\nemblazoned before an indifferent or hostile world.\\n\\nHe also knew the Mexican government would\\n\\nmercilessly undertake to strangle this new-born\\n\\nhope, and forever crush the passionate desire that\\n\\ninspired it. The only question was, how soon\\n\\nwould the storm break? Could he get things\\n\\ngoing and some measure of harvest reaped before\\n\\nRecanza or Tucan or Lavill would fling forward\\n\\na hostile army. He also realized that back of all\\n\\ngovernments of state, nation or race must be\\n\\nhomes, rich with desire for best things, hearts\\n\\nwhite-heated with worthy ambitions. He also\\n\\nbelieved these were latent in the Toltecs ; but by\\n\\nwhat process of spiritual alchemy could they be\\n\\ntranslated into tremendous, persistent action for\\n\\nindividual and national upbuilding?\\n\\n109\\n\\n\\n\\nHis first attempt was the restoration of the\\n\\nToltec dwelling-house. The effect was magical\\n\\nand overwhelming in its grasp and power.\\n\\nFrom specifications given him by Iximaga and\\n\\nplans and detail drawings made by Dalleszona,\\n\\nSaxon and Tullan fashioned the molds, ran the\\n\\ncement for hollow walls, and built the bridge\\n\\nhead above for suction fans that insured coolness\\n\\nduring the hottest days; also set the baths and\\n\\narranged the fountains for patios and lawns, in\\n\\naccordance with ancient Toltec custom, while\\n\\nlazy, unwashed, half-naked men and slovenly\\n\\nwomen watched, smoked, scoffed or half-slept on\\n\\nevery side. But when completed, and the women\\n\\ntook the baths and felt the cool fragrance of the\\n\\nporches, or stood before the splendid mirrors, the\\n\\nspirit of civilization that wrought so mightily in\\n\\ntheir ancestors came to life, and they rose up\\n\\nwith such resistless energy and unconquerable\\n\\n110\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Interpreter of Dreams\\n\\ndesire that the men were swept into action; for\\n\\nwhat a woman really desires with all her heart\\n\\nshe will find some way to get. Those women\\n\\nsuddenly wanted houses with baths and mirrors,\\n\\nand they got them.\\n\\nThe contagion spread to surrounding villages,\\n\\nand the travail of Saxon s soul was satisfied.\\n\\nDalleszona arranged a fiesta for women, and\\n\\nthey came by thousands. Everyone saw the new\\n\\nhogans. Dalleszona saw to that. Desire flamed.\\n\\nGood hogans called for lawns, lawns for clean\\n\\nstreets, streets for better roads. Men were put\\nto work in the seventh treasure, and a stream of\\n\\ngold came forth to buy motor trucks and build\\n\\nrefineries for gasoline. The waste way of the\\n\\nlake on Castile Leon was sealed with cement,\\n\\nand, when rain clouds swept from lake to gulf\\n\\nas in olden days, tractors were set plowing the\\n\\nSahauro flats, and wheat fields that meant un-\\n\\n111\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nlimited foods soon yielded abundant harvests.\\n\\nEvery man was allowed as much ground as he\\n\\ncould work for reasonable harvests, and the\\n\\nuniversal decree was enforced that &quot;He who will\\n\\nnot work shall not eat.&quot; But every one, whether\\n\\nworker with brain or worker with hands, skilled\\n\\nor unskilled, was deemed worthy of a living\\n\\nwage; and all surplus of field, shop or mine was\\n\\npurchased by the national government at a rea\\n\\nsonable price and used for the benefit of all.\\n\\nAirships by scores and hundreds in all sizes for\\n\\ncarrying passengers and merchandise were pro\\n\\nvided with vacuum chambers to insure against\\n\\naccident, and &quot;Safety First&quot; became a nation s\\n\\nwatchword.\\n\\nApplied to conservation of human life it pro\\n\\nhibited public war or private fighting. In eco\\n\\nnomics, &quot;Safety First&quot; demanded one hundred\\n\\nper cent production in all lines to insure against\\n\\n112\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Interpreter of Dreams\\n\\nfamine and pestilence. Socially, it stressed edu\\n\\ncation and conscience against ignorance and\\n\\ndegeneracy.\\n\\nBy means of these same airships provisions of\\n\\nall kinds were quickly distributed everywhere,\\n\\nand all surplus of grains and fruits carried to\\n\\nwarehouses for storage or shipment.\\n\\nTo further add to comfort and contentment, a\\n\\nsystem of universal wireless telephones with re\\n\\nceiving and transmitting device was installed in\\n\\nevery human habitation. Dictagraphs, too, were\\n\\nprovided for all business houses. Schools were\\n\\nprovided for all youth; reading, writing, arith\\n\\nmetic and geography were compulsory for all up\\n\\nto twelve years of age. Beyond this every one\\n\\nfollowed personal inclination as to mechanics,\\n\\nfarming, manufacturing and invention, etc.,\\n\\neverything in the realm of human improvement,\\n\\neach according to ability, but no idlers, shirkers\\n\\n113\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nnor favorites. Every one was perfectly free to\\n\\nwork himself to the limit of skill and industry,\\n\\nbut nobody could exploit his fellow man nor\\n\\nmonopolize any commodity or resource that might\\n\\nbe held for the benefit of all. The only aristoc\\n\\nracy recognized was kindliness and courtesy,\\n\\ncharacter and conscience.\\n\\nGovernment was strictly a business proposition,\\n\\na billion dollar corporation, administered by\\n\\nthe chancellor or manager, with a board of di\\n\\nrectors, limited to one term of efficient honesty.\\n\\nBut under Dalleszona s personal portfolio, &quot;Wel\\n\\nfare of the Nation,&quot; all vital questions were\\n\\nsubmitted to an electorate of the whole people,\\n\\nand a majority vote decided whether a thing\\n\\nshould be carried as a &quot;Public Utility&quot; or as\\n\\na &quot;Private Enterprise,&quot; an absolute democracy\\n\\nwhere the people forever held the sources of\\n\\npower and procedure.\\n\\n114\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Interpreter of Dreams\\n\\nThis program, pushed to the very limit of\\n\\nToltec geographical boundaries, soon attracted\\n\\nmuch attention from all nations, but created no\\n\\nfriction with the Mexican authorities because it\\n\\nwas not forced beyond territorial lines. How\\n\\never, Mexicans on adjacent lands, weary of war\\n\\nthat brought them nothing but misery and got\\n\\nthem nowhere except to the graveyards, soon\\n\\nbegan to breathe the vital currents of this life-\\n\\ngiving contagion, and a large portion of Sonora,\\n\\nChihuahua, Sinaloa, Tepic and Jalisco were in\\n\\nfected with the spirit of democracy, and San Bias\\n\\nand Manzanillo had become mighty terminals for\\n\\nsteamship and airplane lines, carrying millions of\\n\\ndollars of merchandise to and from South Ameri\\n\\ncan ports, and the peon population of these dis\\n\\ntricts were openly soliciting an extension of Tol\\n\\ntec business methods and governmental policies.\\n\\nIn many cases the Toltecs were slow to respond\\n\\n115\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nto these calls, and perhaps this very slowness had\\n\\nmade the peons more insistent. However, con\\n\\nsiderable revenue inured directly to the Mexican\\n\\ngovernment, and the Toltecs were not molested.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Saxon s splendid interpretation\\n\\nof Toltec dreams and marvelous administration\\n\\nand demonstration of democracy had so thor\\n\\noughly developed and transformed the Toltecs\\n\\nthat physically, mentally and spiritually they were\\n\\nbeyond reproach, and Saxon had resolved that\\n\\nthe next requisition for slaves in the southern\\n\\nprovince should not be honored. At the same\\n\\ntime he had no intention of going into battle,\\n\\nexcept as a last resort, and even then only on\\n\\nthe defensive.\\n\\nHe had not long to wait for the test in his\\n\\ncourage.\\n\\nSwift messengers soon arrived, bearing intel\\n\\nligence that notices had been posted in the\\n\\n116\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Interpreter of Dreams\\n\\nsouthern province calling for three hundred boys\\n\\nand two hundred girls, between fifteen and\\n\\ntwenty years of age, of Yaki or other Indian\\n\\nblood, for service on the sisal plantations of\\n\\nYucatan.\\n\\nThe Mexican officials, profiteers and employ\\n\\nment agents seemed to keep account of Yaki\\n\\nyouths, and it was next to impossible to remove\\n\\nthem from their homes, so Saxon determined to\\n\\nappeal direct to the Mexican government. Ac\\n\\ncordingly, messages of protest were forwarded to\\n\\nRacanza and General Rotanzo, who had acted\\n\\nas military escort to kidnapped Yakis on former\\n\\noccasions.\\n\\nInsolent, defiant, arrogant, the answer was\\n\\nreturned by headquarters attache:\\n\\n117\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\n&quot;PERMANENT HEADQUARTERS,\\n\\nGrand Army of Mexico.\\n\\n&quot;Sir:\\n\\n&quot;Under instructions of Mexican Government\\n\\nyou are informed that covenants and agreements\\n\\nare binding only between equals.\\n\\n&quot;The Yakis hold all lands and privileges of\\n\\ntribal relations by sufferance of the Mexican\\n\\nnation and are revocable at pleasure of said\\n\\ngovernment.\\n\\n&quot;Of Tehees we know nothing and care less.\\n\\n&quot;Nine days from to-day, with five thousand\\n\\npicked troops of the regular army of Mexico, I\\n\\nwill march through Terror Pass into the\\n\\nValley of Death.\\n\\n&quot;You are hereby commanded to deliver, the\\n\\nfollowing morning, the five hundred Yaki youths\\n\\nat our headquarters there. If you do not arrive\\n\\n118\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Interpreter of Dreams\\n\\nby eleven o clock the next day, I shall proceed to\\n\\ntake them as on former trips.\\n\\n&quot;Finally, signed, ROTANZO&quot;.\\n\\nWithin twenty-four hours of receipt of above,\\n\\nSaxon had communicated by wireless with every\\n\\nvillage in the northern province, and ten thou\\n\\nsand Toltec youths between twenty-five and\\n\\nthirty years of age were in waiting for orders to\\n\\nsail by aeroplane for the mesa lands adjoining\\n\\nthe &quot;Valley of Death&quot; on the west, ready for\\n\\nwhatever action might be required.\\n\\nThe morning of the tenth day, at precisely ten\\n\\no clock A.M., Saxon, Iximaga, Dalleszona and\\n\\nTullan anchored the Mystery Maid near a clump\\n\\nof manzanite, and thirty minutes later a thou\\n\\nsand airplanes were arranged along the western\\n\\nslope, and Saxon hoped by this splendid array to\\n\\ncommand annulment of the slavery order.\\n\\n119\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nUnder a flag of truce, Iximaga, Saxon, Dalles\\n\\nzona and Tullan walked down to the river bed,\\n\\nwhere they were met by General Rotanzo and\\n\\nstaff; but the Mexican troops arranged along the\\n\\neastern bank of the river, could hear plainly, as\\n\\nIximaga intended they should.\\n\\nAfter formal introductions Iximaga spoke:\\n\\n&quot;Brothers, and I hope friends, we are here\\n\\npleading for peace and the right to live. We are\\nwilling to concede lands and accumulated prop\\n\\nerty, personal belongings, the fruit of toil,\\n\\neverything possible. But you are asking the im\\n\\npossible. Our sons and daughters cannot be\\n\\nbought nor sold nor exchanged. Manhood and\\n\\nwomanhood are more sacred to us than gold or\\n\\ngems. Human life cannot be treated as a pos\\n\\nsession, now or ever.\\n\\n&quot;Long centuries ago my people possessed this\\n\\nland from the Mayan Gulf to the Mother Sea.\\n\\n120\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Interpreter of Dreams\\n\\nOur power was broken, our homes despoiled.\\n\\nWe have suffered persecutions even unto death.\\nAs long as there were vacant lands to go to, we\\n\\nwent to them. Now there is no land for us to\\n\\ngo to. We miust live here or perish. We desire\\nto live in peace ; according to all others the same\\n\\nrights we claim for ourselves. We do not covet\\n\\nyour lands. As long as your troops remain on\\n\\nthe eastern side of this River of Death, you\\n\\nare safe. If you come to our side to take our\\n\\npeople, we shall resist to the limit of power, the\\n\\nlast ounce of blood and body. With peace and\\n\\ngood will there is abundance for all. Without\\n\\nthese there is nothing for anyone.&quot;\\n\\nAs Iximaga ceased speaking, Saxon stepped\\n\\nforward to address the soldiers on the river bank.\\n\\nAt sight of his rugged form and clean-cut face,\\n\\nthe cry of &quot;Gringo! Gringo! Americano!&quot; was\\n\\nshouted down the lines, and wildest excitement\\n\\n121\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nprevailed for a few minutes, then utter quiet and\\n\\nclosest attention.\\n\\n&quot;Fellow-citizens of a new world, I was born\\n\\non American soil. My parents are from Asia.\\nFor two years I have battled in Europe for\\n\\nhumanity and democratic civilization. Now I\\nhave cast my lot for life or for death with the\\n\\nToltecs, and am doing my utmost to help build\\n\\nup a democracy founded on the proposition of\\n\\nEqual Rights to All, Special Privileges to None.\\n\\n&quot;Hear me! For six thousand years this old\\n\\nworld has tried to settle its difficulties by war,\\n\\nfists, clubs, knives, arrows, lances, guns and\\n\\ndeadly gas. The farther we go along that road,\\nthe worse for all. Why not try another way?\\n\\n&quot;My experience in Europe convinces me that\\n\\nour trouble comes from false leaders. The\\n\\n122\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Interpreter of Dreams\\n\\nworld s armies of the last five years left to them\\n\\nselves never would have begun slaughter. If the\\n\\nkings, czars, emperors, kaisers, sultans, princes\\n\\nand royal blood had been forced into the first\\n\\nwave of battle, there would have been no war.\\n\\nI believe your officers to-day are to blame for this\\n\\nbattle array. If they had to lead, instead of\\n\\nsending you into battle, there would be no battle.\\n\\n&quot;I challenge you! Require your General and\\n\\nstaff to be the first to cross this Valley of Death.\\n\\nWhy should you be sent to slaughter while they\\nremain in safety? You have all to lose, nothing\\n\\nto gain.&quot;\\n\\nThen turning to the Mexican general and\\n\\naides :\\n\\n&quot;I promise you, gentlemen, that if any blood\\n\\nis spilled to-day, yours will be the first. The\\n\\npeople I stand with will never try to enlarge\\n\\ntheir present land holdings by conquest; but, if\\n\\n123\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nyou climb the western bank of this River of\\n\\nDeath, every element of destruction \\\\ve possess\\n\\nwill be brought to bear to preserve the lives and\\n\\nhonor of our sons and daughters.\\n\\n&quot;You have my answer. I am done.&quot;\\n\\nThen the unexpected happened.\\n\\nThrowing aside her aviator s hood and wine-\\n\\ncolored reboso, Dalleszona stood before the\\n\\nmighty throng, her hair in shining braids, face\\n\\nradiant with high resolve, eyes aflame and hands\\n\\noutspread in tragic appeal, a veritable flesh-and-\\n\\nblood Goddess of Liberty clothed in shimmering\\n\\nwhite.\\n\\n&quot;Fathers, husbands, sons, brothers, lovers all,\\n\\nI challenge you to think of your mothers, wives,\\n\\ndaughters, sweethearts, and ask your souls what\\n\\nthey would have you do in this rugged and tre\\n\\nmendous hour. In the name of the womanhood\\n\\nof a world, that suffers first and most in war,\\n\\n124\\n\\n\\n\\nI ask you to throw down your guns, forsake the\\n\\npaths of slaughter, murder and slavery, and make\\n\\nglad and happy this garden land of God, and\\n\\nlift high before a war-weary world the white\\n\\nflag of Peace and Good Will among men. I\\n\\nask you to place, here and now, the cornerstone\\n\\nof a civilization unstained by human blood, the\\n\\nfoundations of a democratic brotherhood which\\n\\nshall inaugurate an era of progress as enduring\\n\\nas the light of fixed stars, as far-reaching as the\\n\\nlonging of human hearts. Oh, I pray you, sol\\n\\ndiers of this marvelous land, do not let the roll\\n\\nof drum nor blast of bugle, or any other call to\\n\\norganized loot and slaughter, sound sweeter in\\n\\nyour souls than the songs of happy wives and\\n\\nmothers, or the voices of children playing where\\n\\nthe oleanders bloom; in the valley and pome\\n\\ngranate ripen on the hillsides. Love, cherish,\\n\\nhonor and protect the homes of this heaven-blest\\n\\n125\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nland, and the womanhood of a world will call\\n\\nyou blessed, and you shall be you shall be\\n\\nblessed.&quot;\\n\\nSaxon had not known of her intention to\\n\\nspeak; but, as he listened to her persuasive\\n\\nappeal and caught the inspiring thrill of her\\n\\ninfectious enthusiasm, he felt she had never\\n\\nappeared so divinely fair as now, in utter self-\\n\\nforgetfulness, in an hour fraught with possibili\\n\\nties of personal danger, pleading the inalienable\\n\\nrights of womanhood, to Life, Liberty and the\\n\\nPursuit of Happiness in the homes of a world.\\n\\nWhat the influence of her appeal upon the\\n\\ngeneral and staff might be he could not hazard\\n\\neven a guess ; but, as they returned to the\\n\\nMystery Maid on the western slopes, there was\\n\\nshouting and a babel of voices among the troops.\\n\\nWith powerful binoculars he could see the\\n\\nofficers riding and gesticulating along the fighting\\n\\n126\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Interpreter of Dreams\\n\\nlines, and with a strong but delicate dictaphone\\n\\ncaught the drift of tumultuous excitement.\\n\\nFully convinced that the officers and probably\\n\\npart of the troops would make some attempt to\\n\\nenforce the message of the government, Saxon\\n\\npassed orders to the crews of a hundred bombing\\n\\nplanes to follow the movements of the Mystery\\n\\nMaid.\\n\\nAt a quarter past eleven o clock General Ro-\\n\\ntanzo and about one hundred aides dropped into\\n\\nthe river bed, and a few minutes later appeared\\n\\nupon the western bank on Toltec soil. At the\\n\\nsame time about a thousand troops marched in\\n\\nfighting formation down into the river bed and\\n\\nhalted there.\\n\\nSaxon knew the moment for action had ar\\n\\nrived. Without a moment s hesitation he set the\\n\\nDe Haviland s motors whirring, and, as the\\n\\nMystery Maid breasted the air, a hundred bomb-\\n\\n127\\n\\n\\n\\nDallcszona\\n\\ning planes swung into fighting formation with\\n\\nflashing of wings and roar of propeller blades\\n\\nterrible yet thrilling to see.\\n\\nFrom boyhood Saxon had been a lover of\\n\\npeace ; but, whenever forced to fight, his program\\n\\nwas to fight as hard as possible, and this in\\n\\nstruction was now given to the crews of the\\n\\nbombing planes.\\n\\nSaxon s plan of battle was to do all possible\\n\\ndamage to the invaders of Toltec soil, but in no\\n\\ncase to carry battle on to Mexican soil, so he\\n\\nhurled his aero-squadrons in sets of four, at right\\n\\nangles to the line of Rotanzo s advance. Passing\\n\\nbeyond the line of advance, the odd numbers\\n\\nswung to the right, even to the left, each execut\\n\\ning a double Immclmann turn and again joining\\n\\nthe attacking column, so that to the watchers in\\n\\nthe river bed there seemed to be an absolutely\\n\\nendless supply of planes.\\n\\n128\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Interpreter of Dreams\\n\\nLike fiery thunderbolts these submarines of the\\n\\naerial ocean shot forward with headlights of\\n\\nblazing power and red reflectors swung from\\n\\nrudder bands, as spectre hosts from the pits of\\n\\nthe doomed, each manned by a mechanician, pilot\\n\\nand two bombers.\\n\\nAt signal from Saxon the timed bombs filled\\n\\nwith bullets, brimstone and T. N. T. were\\n\\ndropped from the pits, quickly followed by\\n\\nchemical explosive bombs known only to Toltec\\n\\nlaboratories. Time bombs bursting in air as well\\n\\nas on the ground created havoc among the gene\\n\\nral s staff; but, when the chemicals struck the\\n\\nground and became sheets of flame and rivers of\\n\\nfire upon the earth, the destruction was appalling.\\n\\nLiterally, it was &quot;Bullets and Brimstone,&quot; &quot;Hail\\n\\nand Hell.&quot; Horses plunged about in wrild dis\\n\\norder, clothes of the officers and trappings of\\n\\nsaddles caught fire, and horses and riders fled\\n\\n129\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\ntoward the river bed as living torches. But the\\n\\nleft wing of Saxon s air-legions had dropped a\\n\\nline of bombs between them and the river bank.\\n\\nRetreat was impossible. Also in addition to\\n\\nbombs and flame, long lines or ribbons of in\\n\\nflammable films set with time fuse, that pro\\n\\npelled themselves as fierce serpents through the\\n\\nair or along the ground streamed from the\\n\\ncavalry of the clouds. At regular intervals in\\n\\nthese films were acid capsules that struck and\\n\\nburst as with stings of scorpions. Earth and air\\n\\nbecame a maelstrom of destruction, cauldron of\\n\\ndeath, a veritable inferno in which human beings\\n\\nof flesh and blood could not live. Not a single\\n\\nofficer escaped.\\n\\nTransfixed with horror as they gazed upon the\\n\\nawful scene, the troops held their lines intact\\n\\nuntil every officer had gone do\\\\vn to rise no\\n\\nmore, then consternation seized them, and they\\n\\n130\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Interpreter of Dreams\\n\\nfled in broken ranks and wildest confusion toward\\n\\n&quot;Terror Pass,&quot; closely followed by the soldiers\\n\\nwho had entered the river bed.\\n\\nThe Toltec victory was absolute and complete.\\n\\nIn fact, the fleeing, panic-stricken troops carried\\n\\nsuch tales of &quot;a sea of fire mingled with blood,&quot;\\n\\nthat the Mexican government could not secure\\n\\nvolunteers nor force drafted men to enter the\\n\\nYaki lands, and the Toltecs had peace and safety\\n\\nas never before since the Aztecs pillaged their\\n\\ncities and the Spaniards robbed their temples and\\n\\nhomes.\\n\\nDalleszona sat at Saxon s side through all the\\n\\nbattle, cheering him on, and rejoiced at the de\\n\\nliverance of her people; but her woman s heart\\n\\nwas full of sorrow and tenderness for the Mexi\\n\\ncan leaders who perished so miserably in the\\n\\n&quot;Valley of Death.&quot;\\n\\nAt her request all the bodies were carried\\n\\n131\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nacross the river channel and given decent burial\\n\\nin Mexican soil, while she chanted in sobbing\\n\\ntones that wondrously sweet melody of the\\n\\nToltecs for departing souls.\\n\\nWhen they had returned to Truxlan, Iximaga\\nand Tullan went direct to the Administration\\n\\nBuilding to set the automatic wireless working,\\n\\nso the homes all over the nation might have the\\n\\ncheer of the victorious action of the Toltec\\n\\nlegions in Death Valley, and carry to the south\\n\\nern provinces the glad assurance that never more\\n\\nwould their sons and daughters be sold into\\n\\nslavery.\\n\\nDalleszona was so quiet and thoughtful that\\n\\nSaxon took her for a stroll in the capitol gardens,\\n\\nin hope of helping her to forget the awful battle\\n\\nscenes that had so shocked her sensitive spirit\\n\\nand still threw its shadows across her soul.\\n\\n132\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Interpreter of Dreams\\n\\nScarcely were they seated in a fragrant pergola,\\n\\nwhen she turned to him with intense earnestness\\n\\nand said:\\n\\n&quot;Oh, Mr. Saxon, I thank you with all my\\n\\nheart and soul for the splendid deliverance you\\n\\nhave accomplished for my people to-day and\\n\\nthrough the years. And I am praying there will\\n\\nbe no more battles, ever, in this fair land of ours.\\n\\nBut that is not enough, and cannot be, unless the\\n\\nrest of the world shall be led to the blessings of\\n\\npeace and brotherhood. I want you to promise\\n\\nme that, if you are elected chancellor at the\\n\\ncoming elections, you will immediately enter\\n\\nupon a program of world-wide peace education.\\n\\nBegin with the children in the schools of all\\n\\nnations with songs and movies that shall em\\n\\nblazon the spirit of love and brotherhood every\\n\\nwhere. Carry your peace propaganda to the\\n\\n133\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nmothers of every tribe and tongue, and inspire\\n\\nthem with the mighty truth that it is infinitely\\n\\nwiser to invest millions and millions in growing\\n\\na race of peace-lovers than to spend billions in\\n\\ngatling guns and battleships to shoot bankruptcy\\n\\nand murder around the world. Fling your air-\\n\\nsquadrons white-winged messengers of peaceful\\n\\nconquest across the seas, and with your electric\\n\\nfilms write upon the very heavens there, &quot;Thou\\n\\nshalt not kill.&quot; I believe this to be the heroic,\\n\\nbeautiful task for which America s greatest na\\n\\ntion has been given unlimited wealth and power,\\n\\nand is now called upon to inaugurate. I assure\\n\\nyou the womanhood of the world will support\\n\\nyou with all her matchless powers, and is ready\\n\\nnow to fling herself with deathless loyalty into\\n\\nthis immortal campaign.&quot;\\n\\nFor a moment Saxon was staggered by the\\n\\nimmensity of the task; but, as he caught the\\n\\n184\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Interpreter of Dreams\\n\\nsplendor and sweep of Dalleszona s vision, hu\\n\\nman limitations seemed to melt away, and he\\n\\npromised all that he was, or might be, to the\\n\\ngirl s inspiring call.\\n\\n135\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\nTOLTEC TRAILS\\n\\nBy old trail and bold trail, swinging toward the\\n\\ndawn\\n;\\n\\nBy sky-trail and cloud-trail, ever luring on;\\n\\nBy heart-power and soul-power only may we\\n\\nclimb\\n\\nThe new trail, the true trail, to life and love\\n\\nsublime.\\n\\nHow much of cheer and forgetfulness of war s\\nterrific scenes the hour in the park had brought\\n\\nto Dalleszona, Saxon could not know ; but his\\n\\nown soul was refreshed and strengthened beyond\\n\\nmeasure. Still, he was not in a mood to attend\\n\\nto the affairs of ordinary routine, so did not\\n\\nreturn to the administration offices that evening.\\n\\n136\\n\\n\\n\\nToltcc Trails\\n\\nThe fascination of the tremendous program of\\n\\nworld life, peace and universal brotherhood, out\\n\\nlined by Dalleszona, thrilled and thralled his\\n\\nsoul with possibilities almost divine through the\\n\\ntwilight hour, and held him sleepless far into the\\n\\nnight. Even the next morning the beacon lights\\n\\nshe had kindled still glowed along the shores of\\n\\nthe Unknown with inspiring grandeur.\\n\\nHer genius and enthusiasm had so completely\\n\\npossessed him that he resolved to ask her to go\\n\\nwrith him for a visit to the Old Garden, with\\n\\nits treasures of art and romance of American\\n\\nantiquities.\\n\\nHe found her in the fragrant pergola, busy\\nwith some rolls of parchment, but clothed in\\n\\naviation garb.\\n\\n&quot;I knew you would come,&quot; she said, &quot;and\\n\\nhave luncheon prepared. Oh, you men ! How\\n\\nyou boast of persistency and steadfast holding to\\n\\n137\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nbusiness and affairs of state; but, just the same,\\n\\nlet a woman disclose the fringe of a new fashion\\n\\nin politics or religion, philosophy, art or love,\\n\\nand you are completely consumed by curiosity.\\n\\nReally, just had to come, didn t you? Now, sir,\\n\\nI m laying a wager that you did not sleep three\\nhours last night. Come, now, do you really feel\\n\\nequal to an excursion in cloudland ?&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Well,&quot;\\nhe smiled back, &quot;I always have some\\n\\ngovernmental affairs to wrestle with!&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Affairs of state ! Yes, and you solved every\\n\\none of them, too, so have nothing to do to-day\\n\\nexcept joy sailing.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Well, we will let it go at that, so you may\\n\\nbring the Mystery Maid around, and I ll show\\n\\nyou a new standard of holiday that will put a\\n\\ncrimp on all your stock of curiosity and former\\n\\nvacations. I promise you, here and now, we are\\n\\noff for a flight which will make you forget the\\n\\n138\\n\\n\\n\\nToltec Trails\\n\\nflavor of any affairs of state that you ever con\\n\\njured on Toltec soil.&quot;\\n\\nDalleszona took the wheel, and soon had the\\n\\npowerful De Haviland speeding fast and high\\n\\ntoward the &quot;Land of Unclouded Day.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Now, Mr. Chancellor, we are really on the\\n\\nway, and I m going to show you historic treas\\nures that will cause you to see visions and dream\\n\\ndreams for centuries to come; for I expect some\\n\\ntime in the great onrushing future, in realms\\n\\nbeyond the shores of earth, your immortal law\\n\\ngiver, Moses, will appoint you to a place with\\n\\nhis corps of celestial engineers, and you will be\\n\\npulling planets into position and arranging solar\\n\\nsystems in space, or, perchance, piloting blazing\\n\\nmeteors along the shores of that vast abyss where\\n\\npower creative never yet has energized and\\n\\nexistence still sleeps in the realms of Possibility.\\n\\n&quot;You know, in all ages, every nation, race and\\n\\n139\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\npeople have had great leaders, philanthropists,\\n\\nprophets, lawgivers, because that is the way the\\n\\nEternal works out human progress.\\n\\n&quot;Nearly two thousand years ago the Toltecs\\n\\nwere transfigured and glorified by an immortal\\n\\ngenius, Cholula Chimhueves; and to-day I will\\n\\nshow you his indestructible library, the greatest\\n\\nof earth, and read for you some lines of his im\\n\\nmortal wisdom, which will yet blaze and brighten\\n\\nacross our thousand years of darkness.&quot;\\n\\nAs Saxon listened to this wild promise, seem\\n\\ningly impossible of fulfillment, a wireless S. O. S.\\n\\nflashed across heart and brain, &quot;This woman is\\n\\nlunatic. The battle of the clouds of yesterday\\nhas wrecked her mind.&quot;\\n\\nHowever, her ability to control the De Havi-\\n\\nland was perfect, and he decided to fall in with\\n\\nher mood so long as life was not endangered;\\n\\nbut it was not any pleasure to feel that he was\\n\\n140\\n\\n\\n\\nToltec Trails\\n\\nbeing hurled through the air at above a hundred\\n\\nmiles an hour, with a maniac at the wheel.\\n\\nMeanwhile, she had gradually increased speed\\n\\nuntil, with wide-open throttle and reverse lever\\n\\nin working position, the Mystery Maid was cer\\n\\ntainly attaining a speed of one hundred twenty-\\n\\nfive miles an hour, headed due north, and already\\n\\nfar past the Garden of Castile Leon.\\n\\nAs they neared the international boundary, she\\n\\nturned to him with blazing eyes, and said:\\n\\n&quot;Please take my binoculars and watch closely for\\n\\nyour Uncle Sam s patrol. I do not want to break\\n\\nany international rules of etiquette, but we must\\n\\ncross the border; and I do not want to be ques\\n\\ntioned nor delayed by Custom House officials\\n\\nand red tape.&quot;\\n\\nScarcely had she finished speaking, when Saxon\\n\\ndiscovered several scout planes already in the air\\n\\nand only a few miles ahead, but flying low under\\n\\n141\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nwhat seemed to be a desert storm cloud extend\\n\\ning far eastward from No Man s Mountain.\\nAs they neared the border, two of the planes\\n\\nsignalled danger; but Dalleszona answered by\\n\\nthrowing the beak of the De Haviland upward\\n\\nto an angle that would hurl them into the storm\\n\\ncloud, now blazing with electrical wrath and\\n\\nbooming with omnipotent voices.\\n\\nUndoubtedly the patrol divined her intention,\\n\\nfor they quickly formed a &quot;V&quot; shaped pocket,\\n\\nwith purpose to force a landing. TTwas of no\\n\\navail. They had underestimated her speed, arid\\n\\nthe terrific rush of Dalleszona s craft carried her\\n\\nabove the topmost plane, but by such close margin\\n\\nthat the wing of the scout plane was crushed\\n\\nby the &quot;tail skid&quot; of the Mystery Maid, and\\n\\nswirled to the ground, while the De Haviland\\n\\nplunged into the cloud and was lost to view of\\n\\nthe other patrols.\\n\\n142\\n\\n\\n\\nToltec Trails\\n\\nChain lightning blazed in javelin shafts all\\n\\nabout them, while electric halos played around\\n\\npropeller blades and dropped from rudder bands\\n\\nin flaming grandeur like unto a comet s train.\\n\\nFor a brief moment Saxon felt the end had\\n\\ncome, but sent up a swift prayer for some sort\\n\\nof deliverance from immediate destruction.\\n\\nOnly a moment thus ; then he glanced at Dal-\\n\\nleszona, and his soul was quieted forevermore.\\n\\nNever again could he know fear; for back of the\\n\\neyes of lambent flame, beyond the veil of her\\n\\nflesh and blood, he saw the woman s soul, keen\\n\\nas electric fire, but sweet, pure, true, clean, as\\n\\nshe made her appeal to the heart of the Great\\n\\nSpirit. Conscious of the integrity of her inten\\n\\ntions, perfect love had cast out all fear.\\n\\nThe contagion of Dalleszona s intrepid spirit,\\n\\nfearless as divine power, courageous as immortal\\n\\n143\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nwisdom, submerged his spirit with a sense of\\n\\ninfinite trust.\\n\\nWith smiling face and steady hand she threw\\n\\nthe wheel hard over to the left, the plane shot\\n\\nthrough and above the cloud, and with un-\\n\\ndiminished speed held directly westward and at\\n\\nright angles to their former course.\\n\\nThen, turning a radiant face upon Saxon, she\\n\\nsaid :\\n\\n&quot;Mr. Chancellor, this flight is in answer to\\n\\nS. O. S. from world civilization, and the avenues\\n\\nand cloud trails of the Great Spirit of the Toltecs\\n\\nmust ever be open and free for his loving\\n\\nchildren.&quot;\\n\\nAs they neared Yuma, she again headed north\\n\\nward, and, passing beyond the cloud barrage, was\\n\\nsighted by other patrols, and there was nothing\\n\\nto do but climb; and climb she did, in ever\\n\\nwidening circles, until the aerometer registered\\n\\n144\\n\\n\\n\\nToltec Trails\\n\\nthree thousand fathoms and the binoculars re\\n\\nvealed the scout planes returning to their base.\\n\\nAgain, with a contented smile, she said, &quot;Mr.\\n\\nSaxon, what we see and do to-day is strictly our\\n\\nown business, not your Uncle Sam s. We shall\\nnot infringe upon his rights nor harm his pos\\n\\nsessions, and I propose to come and go to-day\\n\\nwithout hail or farewell from anybody.&quot;\\n\\nStill northward she held her course until the\\n\\nSalt River and Bill Williams Fork were crossed,\\n\\nthen she landed on a sandy stretch screened by\\n\\nwillows on one side and frowning cliffs on the\\n\\nother, on the California side, some three miles\\n\\nbelow Topock, and the great Santa Fe bridge\\n\\nacross the Colorado River, twelve miles below\\n\\nNeedles.\\n\\nFollowing a rugged path, Dalleszona led the\\n\\nway to a broad, rock-strewn mesa, where a sight\\n\\ngreeted Saxon s eyes that startled and amazed\\n\\n145\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nhim, even as the record it will some day reveal\\n\\nshall startle and thrill a world of science and\\n\\nhistory.\\n\\nHe could scarcely believe his own eyes, as he\\n\\ngazed upon acres and acres of smooth-faced\\n\\nboulders and slabs of malapi, engraved with\\n\\nclosely written, beautiful hieroglyphics.\\n\\nWith a wave of her hand toward the writing,\\n\\nDalleszona turned to Saxon and said: &quot;Mr.\\n\\nSaxon, here are the records of America s ancient\\n\\ncivilization, etched by the pens of secretaries\\n\\nunder the personal direction and supervision of\\n\\nour own great historian and lawgiver, Cholula\\n\\nChimhueves, mightiest mind and heart of Toltec s\\n\\ngolden age, a record more perfect and complete\\n\\nthan all the cuneiform tablets and picture-writing\\n\\nrolls of Babylon and Egypt combined, for here\\n\\nyou see a perfect system of shorthand that, if\\n\\n146\\n\\n\\n\\nToltec Trails\\n\\nfully written out, would cover hundreds of\\n\\nacres.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;How many workers and how long did it take\\n\\nto do this seemingly impossible thing?&quot; Saxon\\n\\nasked.\\n\\nDalleszona laughed in happy, glad-hearted\\n\\nfashion, as she replied : &quot;Not so long as you might\\n\\nthink, for the simple reason that Chimhueves was\\n\\nan analytical chemist and applied an acid paste\\n\\nto all surfaces, which practically smelted the fiber\\n\\nof the rocks until the writing was done. Then\\n\\nthe paste was washed off and another acid applied,\\n\\nwhich chilled and hardened as water sets cement,\\n\\nthereby rendering the record imperishable for all\\n\\ntime. It was this treatment that gives it the\\n\\nappearance of having sometime passed through\\n\\nvolcanic fire.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Have your people preserved the key to this\\n\\n147\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nwriting? Can you translate what is recorded\\n\\nhere?&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Assuredly. Come, let us pass over to the\\n\\nextreme southwestern corner of this wide-spread\\n\\ning page, and I will translate some bits of verse\\n\\nat the very beginning.&quot;\\n\\nFrom the folds of her reboso, Dalleszona took\\n\\na roll of parchment, gray with age, but the char\\n\\nacters traced upon it were beyond question the\\n\\nsame as those etched on the stones at his feet.\\n\\nWith a few words of explanation she gave him\\n\\nthe key to the whole system, then read the\\n\\nfollowing :\\n\\n&quot;COZMOTL S SONG\\n\\n&quot;Earth-quaked and thunder-riven,\\n\\nWide-flung, her mountains stand.\\n\\nDeep, beneath her vales are hidden\\n\\nSilver-reefs and golden sands.\\n\\n148\\n\\n\\n\\nToltec Trails\\n\\nOut across her sagey washes\\n\\nFloats a veil of golden mist,\\n\\nTrailing from her peaks and ridges\\n\\nBy the sun eternal kist.\\n\\n&quot;Till the soul is lost in wonder,\\n\\nFadeless scenes of phantom splendor\\n\\nShe can quickly summon from the realm of\\n\\nlegends bold.\\n\\nFacts and fancies she will render\\n\\nOf romances strong and tender\\n\\nThat alone in voiceless language of the desert\\n\\ncan be told.\\n\\n&quot;O land beneath the setting sun,\\n\\nMore fair than sage or poet s dream,\\n\\nCreative power new glories won\\n\\nWhere bright thy stars through azure gleam.\\n\\n149\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nThy treasures great no mortal tongue\\nCan clear describe nor fairly name.\\n\\nO er swinging seas, when earth was young,\\nTo thy fair shores Cozmotl came.\\n\\n&quot;To peace and progress valleys woke.\\n\\nWith holy love and freedom s flame\\n\\nEarth s highest civilization spoke\\n\\nWhere templed-homes gave God acclaim.\\n\\nFrom Mayan Gulf to Mother Sea,\\n\\nFrom tropic strand to snow-clad height,\\n\\nEnriched and robed with mystery,\\n\\nMan s garden land of pure delight.\\n\\n&quot;Thy azure dome with starlight gemmed,\\n\\nFoundations set with crystalled gold ;\\n\\nThy valleys girt and diademmed\\n\\nWith beauty marvelous to behold,\\n\\n150\\n\\n\\n\\nToltec Trails\\n\\nAll lands, all realms, must yield to thee\\n\\nTranscendent plan, immortal clime,\\n\\nEarth s wonderland from sea to sea,\\n\\nGod s masterpiece for earth and time.&quot;\\n\\nFor hours they wandered through this maze of\\n\\nwriting, translating rare passages here and there,\\n\\nas fancy prompted.\\n\\nWith three of these, the story of the Cliff\\n\\nDwellers, petrified forests, and buried cities of\\n\\nArizona, Saxon was intensely interested, and\\n\\nplied Dalleszona with questions concerning them\\n\\nall through the luncheon hour.\\n\\nWhen that noontide hour, so full of ineffable\\n\\nsweetness for both, was ended, the Mystery Maid\\n\\ncircled above the red-silted, mighty river, and at\\n\\nan altitude of two thousand fathoms fled south\\n\\nward toward the wooded heights of Castile Leon.\\n\\nAs they rose above the historic scene, forever-\\n\\n151\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nmore enshrined in the happiness and joy of perfect\\n\\ncompanionship, Saxon looked closely into Dal-\\n\\nleszona s eyes, now illumined with unspeakable\\n\\ngladness, and said: &quot;My very best friend, what\\n\\never the future may hold for your people, or for\\n\\nyou and me, this day will always be a beginning\\n\\nof years for me. You have made good your\\n\\npromise: I shall evermore see visions and dream\\n\\ndreams in all my waking hours. And, oh, so\\n\\nsweet shall be my dreams!&quot;\\n\\nHer voice was low, full-throated and rich with\\n\\nsweetest music to his heart, as she replied : &quot;The\\n\\nhalf has not been revealed. You have had only\\n\\na glimpse of the historical records of my nation s\\n\\nachievement. Now we are going to see the\\n\\nmasterpieces of genius, the charm of home life,\\n\\nthe glory of personal character and privilege that\\n\\nalone can make a race or nation worth while. I\\n\\nwill show you the fullness of art, engravings of\\n\\n152\\n\\n\\n\\nToltec Trails\\n\\ngold, etchings of silver, rainbow prisms and\\n\\ncylinders of diamond glass, polishing of precious\\n\\ngems, origin of standard of measurements, time,\\n\\npower, also laboratory processes for determining\\n\\nhuman dispositions, will power and emotions.&quot;\\n\\nThe old garden was a riot of bloom and\\n\\nlanguorous charm. Resting in its cool retreats or\\n\\nstrolling along its gravelled walks, Saxon was\\n\\nquite willing to enjoy as long as possible the\\n\\natmosphere of mystery and romance ; but Dalles-\\n\\nzona s spirit, still under the spell of the world-\\n\\nbuilder s vision, soon led him to the bougainvillaea\\n\\ndraperied cliffs, where the guard rolled aside the\\n\\nmassive jasper doors and they entered the granite\\n\\ncorridors.\\n\\nWhen candles were lighted, Saxon rolled aside\\nthe chalcedony disc, and they passed into the hall\\n\\nof Toltec Immortals.\\n\\nHalfway down the long rows of illustrious\\n\\n153\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\ndead Dalleszona paused before a form that was\\n\\nstill majestic and noble.\\n\\n&quot;This, Mr. Saxon, is all that human hands\\n\\ncould preserve of our mighty Chimhueves.&quot;\\n\\nLong and silently Saxon gazed upon the mas\\n\\nsive shoulders and magnificent head, broad and\\n\\nhigh-domed above a kindly, kingly face, trying to\\n\\nsee him as he must have been in the heyday of\\n\\nhis power, till a sign from Dalleszona caused him\\n\\nto turn to a woman s form across the aisle.\\n\\n&quot;This is our Queen Mother, Rozemma Man-\\n\\nzillura, scholar, artist, constructive architect\\n\\nand genii of Toltec splendor and renown. This\\n\\nwoirtan could make the marble speak and cause\\n\\nthe water to murmur down the painted landscape.\\n\\nShe filled the hearts of men and women with an\\n\\nenthusiasm so overmastering and overwhelming\\n\\nin the splendor and sweep of its deathless passion,\\n\\nthat a whole race was lifted to highest ideals and\\n\\n154\\n\\n\\n\\nTo Itec Trails\\n\\ncommitted irrevocably to kindliness, truth and\\n\\nhonor. It was her great heart that inspired a\\n\\nnation with a love for the beautiful; her match\\n\\nless brain that devised a system of measurement,\\n\\npower and time that made order and progress\\n\\npossible and launched a mixed multitude of\\n\\npeople on the currents of civilized national life.\\n\\nHer hands first traced the outlines of written\\n\\nlanguage you saw in the Chimhueves library.&quot;\\n\\nWhat Saxon saw was a woman s form and face\\n\\nof marvelous beauty, possibly fifty years of age,\\n\\nnot a hideous shrivelled mummy, but a perfect\\n\\nphysical woman done in rose pink satin spar, so\\n\\nlifelike that he almost expected her to speak to\\n\\nhim.\\n\\n&quot;But, Dalleszona, what magic is this? Do\\n\\nyou mean to tell me that your people were able\\n\\nto defy the corroding hands of time, or am I\\n\\n155\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nhypnotized into seeing what might be, rather than\\n\\nwhat is?\\n5\\n\\n&quot;Come with\\nme,&quot; she said, &quot;to the Hall of\\n\\nRecords, and I will translate Rosemma s memory\\n\\ntablets and answrer all your questions.&quot;\\n\\nPast flashing gems and crystalled columns she\\n\\nled him far do\\\\vn the jewelled corridor of this\\n\\nunderground palace, and seated him upon a divan\\n\\nof polished chalcedony inlaid with pearls, while\\n\\nfrom a nearby table she brought a medallion of\\n\\nbeaten gold more than two feet in diameter,\\n\\nrichly engraved with shorthand writing, and,\\n\\nsitting beside him, began to translate the record,\\n\\nwhen he interrupted her.\\n\\n&quot;Please pardon me, Dalleszona, for I m sure\\nthe story you have there is wonderfully interest\\n\\ning, and the medallion itself is perfectly mar\\n\\nvelous; but just now I cannot get away from\\n\\nseeing and thinking of your Queen Mother,\\n\\n156\\n\\n\\n\\nToltec Trails\\n\\nRozemma. Her body is so perfectly preserved,\\n\\nI would scarcely have been surprised more if she\\n\\nhad spoken. Tell me, Dalleszona, by what\\n\\ndivine power or art did your ancestors do this\\n\\nthing?&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Yes, I ll gladly tell you all about this, though\\n\\nit is the saddest passage in the history of the\\n\\nToltecs, and all of us try to keep as far away\\n\\nfrom it as possible.\\n\\n&quot;Rozemma died very suddenly, probably from\\n\\nheart-failure brought on by over-exertion during\\n\\na gala-day celebration of our graduation exercises\\n\\nfrom the great school of homes at Cholula, of\\n\\nwhich I wish to tell you; but it is a long story,\\n\\nand perhaps you would rather have some other\\n\\nquestions answered now.\\n\\n&quot;At that time there was a spring of mineral\\n\\nwater in the Tlaxcala Mountains that would\\n\\nturn to spar any living creature that drank it,\\n\\n157\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nor anything that was placed in it for a few\\n\\nweeks, and the Toltecs used the waters for pre\\n\\nserving our great ones. Shortly after Rozemma s\\n\\ndeath that section of country was subjected to\\n\\nsevere earthquake, and the water ceased to flow.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Yes, there are other questions I ll have to get\\n\\nout of my system before I can understand your\\n\\nprogram of social and educational life.\\n\\n&quot;Tell me how your construction engineers\\n\\nmoved the tremendous blocks of stone built into\\n\\nyour temples, pyramids and causeways across the\\n\\nlake to your ancient capital city. My people have\\ngreat engineering skill, and construct travelling\\n\\ncranes with mighty lifting power, but cannot\\n\\nmove those enormous blocks.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;This was only one of the works of Rozemma\\n\\nand is really very simple and easy to work out,\\n\\nonce the idea is gained.\\n\\n&quot;A short distance down the coast below the\\n\\n158\\n\\n\\n\\nToltec Trails\\n\\npresent Vera Cruz is a V shaped pocket, or bay,\\nwhere the tides and breakers run extraordinarily\\n\\nhigh and strong. The whole bay is just like the\\n\\nlower jaw of an alligator s mouth, with a rocky\\n\\nreef for tongue. Even at low tide the waves\\n\\nbreak across this tongue writh considerabl force,\\n\\nbut at high tide their rush and power is almost\\n\\nirresistible. On either side of this rocky tongue\\nRozemma placed giant tongs or grappling hooks\\n\\n(similar to those used by the ancient Romans for\\n\\nlifting enemy ships in naval battles), connected\\n\\nabove with wrought copper trusses bearing heavy\\n\\npulleys. Above these she had placed a mighty\\n\\nbarge or pontoon of mahogany, rivetted above and\\n\\nbelow to sheets of hardened copper, from which\\n\\nropes, cords and copper cables passed through\\n\\nthe pulleys, and were carried as far inland as\\n\\ndesired. These were connected to horizontal\\n\\ncapstans at frequent intervals. These capstans\\n\\n159\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nwere provided with sliding bases, so that all slack\\n\\nor pull could be quickly taken care of. These\\n\\ncables were carried back to the quarries in the\\n\\nTlaxcala Hills. When the tides came thunder\\n\\ning in, mounting higher and higher, the pontoon\\n\\nwas lifted, and the strength of the copper cables\\n\\nwas the only limit of power.\\n\\n&quot;Uniform and perpetual, it was easy to tell\\n\\nhow far anything could be moved during any\\n\\nportion of the day; thus both time and distance\\n\\nunits were gained, though the length of the\\n\\nmonth was determined by the full of the moon,\\n\\ntwenty-eight days.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;No need to go farther with that, Dalleszona,\\n\\nI have the formula, and can see clearly how it\\n\\ncould be worked out.\\n\\n&quot;Now I want to know what you meant when\\n\\nyou spoke of determining emotions, will power\\n\\nand character. When you have done this, I think\\n\\n160\\n\\n\\n\\nToltec Trails\\n\\nI may have gained sufficient control of the brain\\n\\nstorm which you started and wrecked my credi\\n\\nbility, so that I can understand the story of your\\n\\nancient home life.&quot;\\n\\nDalleszona reached over, patted his arm,\\n\\nlooked with laughing eyes squarely into his ques\\n\\ntioning ones and said: &quot;Oh, you materialistic\\n\\nAnglo-Saxon, why don t you travel by Vision\\n\\ninstead of by View ? I perceive you are in\\n\\ndanger of being swept into the rapids and whirl\\n\\npools of commercialism, when by all rules of life\\n\\nand love you should be listening to the harmony\\n\\nof divinely appointed programs, ready to sail\\n\\nbeyond the sunset and the paths of all the Wes\\n\\ntern stars, even to the broad pacific of altruistic\\n\\nideals and the realms of immortal genius.\\n\\n&quot;Come with\\nme,&quot; she said, And, taking his\\n\\narm with a way that would have won an an\\n\\nchorite, she led him directly to the most marvel-\\n\\n161\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nous creation of this palace of wonders. &quot;This, I\\n\\nwould have you to know, Sir Chancellor, is more\\n\\nthan an aggregation of gems or collection of\\n\\njewels.\\n\\n&quot;This is a Cozmotl. Originally the word\\n\\nmeant World Builder of material things,\\n\\nhouses, farms, cities, mines, shops, factories,\\n\\nlater applied to nations and civilization itself.\\n\\nFinally it took on the added meaning of health\\n\\nbuilding, disposition and character building.\\n\\n&quot;Through all ages, races and nations have been\\n\\nso busy with hearing, seeing, tasting, smelling and\\n\\nfeeling, that there has been slight chance to\\n\\ndevelop the finer sensibilities, sympathy, gentle\\n\\nness, kindness, courtesy and appreciation.\\n\\n&quot;Long centuries ago the Toltecs knew that the\\n\\noutdoor life in air, water and sunshine was the\\n\\nonly life worth while for the physical body; but\\n\\nit remained for our adorable Rozemma to apply\\n162\\n\\n\\n\\nToltec Trails\\n\\nsunlight, air, water and color to the growth and\\n\\nbeauty of disposition, will power and emotions,\\n\\nthat, all combined, produce character.\\n\\n&quot;Given a sound mind and healthy body, she\\n\\nreasoned a human being would have a kindly\\n\\ndisposition, sweet desires, purposes and good-will\\n\\npower. If nature s forces spelled good physical\\n\\nhealth, why not good disposition and lovable\\n\\ncharacter? In ancient days the rainbow was\\n\\nGod s visible promise the world should never\\n\\nagain be destroyed by violence. Here was a\\n\\nmighty truth. Why not apply it in every realm\\nof human affairs? Surely, war was violence, and\\n\\nhuman beings in a normal state never would\\n\\nengage in organized destruction, the most merci\\n\\nless and brutal of all crimes. There must be a\\n\\ncorrective for the insanity of heart that finds\\n\\nexpression in hate and is infinitely worse than\\n\\ninsanity of mind. If greenery of woods is\\n\\n163\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nuniversally restful to eyes, why not quieting to\\n\\nnerves? If red inflames a bull to fight, why not\\n\\na man to physical vigor and righteous action ?\\n\\nIf violet, indigo and orange make transcendent\\n\\ndawns and magic twilights, may they not give\\n\\ncorresponding beauty and sweetness to desires\\n\\nand emotions?\\n\\n&quot;Now, Mr. Saxon, I m sure this sort of a\\n\\nProspect would have been considered a Certain\\n\\nBonanza by your old friend Highfinger. He\\n\\nhad lived so much with cloud and storm, rain,\\n\\nsun and stars, that he could sense the things im\\n\\npossible to ordinary mortals. I hope and want\\n\\nto believe you are endowed with creative imagina\\n\\ntion\\n; and, once you have dared to sail the un\\n\\ncharted seas of possibility, you will find them\\n\\nresplendent with mightiest rewards.\\n\\n&quot;Do you care to follow the GLEAM?&quot;\\n\\n&quot;I ll say I do. It looks to me like a true\\n\\n164\\n\\n\\n\\nToltec Trails\\n\\nFissure, time wide, heaven high, eternity long.\\n\\nGo ahead; I ll follow, or try to, wherever you\\n\\nmay lead, even unto the Gates of the Eternal\\n\\nMorning.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Well, I expect to go that far sometime, but\\n\\nhope not to-day.\\n\\n&quot;Now, about this Cozmotl. I want you to\\n\\nnotice three things. First, it is made entirely of\\n\\nvolcanic glass and natural gem stones; there is\\n\\nnot a hint of metal or wood about it. Second,\\n\\nit was created by a woman. Third, it was not\\n\\nmade to produce wealth. It was designed to\\n\\nproduce health of body and spirit, and it has done\\n\\nand will do all that we claim for it.&quot;\\n\\nThen, with serious face but laughing eyes, she\\n\\nadded: &quot;No, I m not trying to sell it to you,\\nbecause it is not for sale.\\n\\n&quot;This great cylinder has both inner and outer\\n\\nsides so constructed that water applied to it will\\n\\n165\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nadhere only in drops, and when revolved at\\n\\nproper speed in sunlight will produce a con\\n\\ntinuous rainbow. Over against it we place this\\n\\nobsidian prism so that the primary colors are\\n\\nwidely separated and can be thrown singly upon\\n\\nany object placed on this tourmaline base table.\\n\\n&quot;By many careful experiments Rozemma de\\n\\nmonstrated that the seven primary colors of the\\n\\nrainbow are positive antidotes for seven deadly\\n\\npoisons generated in human minds by the seven\\n\\nprimary vicious emotions, Hate, Fear, Suspicion,\\n\\nEnvy, Jealousy, Revenge and Deceit; that these\\n\\npoisons are distributed by the nerves to all parts\\n\\nof the body, but are subjected to control of will\\n\\npower, also that will power is subject only to\\n\\nthe master passion, Love.\\n\\n&quot;With these interesting facts before her, Roz\\n\\nemma began to systematically observe child life,\\n\\nand soon discovered that children who were fre-\\n\\n166\\n\\n\\n\\nToltec Trails\\n\\nquently subject to certain emotions, sometimes\\n\\nslo\\\\vly, sometimes rapidly, but always surely,\\n\\ndeveloped certain physical weakness that brought\\n\\non sickness of body and degeneracy . of purpose\\n\\nand will; also that in every case the child was\\n\\nextremely responsive to some particular color.\\n\\n&quot;After years of patient research and labor she\\n\\ngave us this Cozmotl, an absolute panacea for\\n\\nall ailments of body and mind ; an unfailing in\\n\\nspiration of good will, kindly disposition and\\n\\nlovable character.\\n\\n&quot;The practical usefulness of this Cozmotl was\\n\\ndemonstrated through five hundred years of na\\n\\ntional life without an epidemic, pestilence or\\n\\nplague, and, what is most wonderful, without\\n\\nwar, riot or violent bloodshed of any kind.\\n\\n&quot;Do you wonder that I am proud to belong to\\n\\na people who made constant progress and climb\\n\\nin every range of human endeavor, and had\\n\\n167\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nraised the average of life to one hundred years\\n\\nof vigor, with peace and abundant good will\\n\\nreigning supreme everywhere among our people,\\n\\nwhen the Aztec came ?\\n\\n&quot;Oh, Mr. Saxon, I am sure you will catch\\n\\nthe vision of what unspeakable blessing that sort\\n\\nof regime could bring to family and educational\\n\\nlife, and, understanding, appreciate the temper\\n\\nand spirit of a great race who gave supreme con\\n\\nsideration in their national purpose and program\\n\\nto the building of lives, broad-browed, warm\\n\\nhearted, sunny-souled men and women.&quot;\\n\\nThen a wave of consternation swept across her\\n\\nbeautiful face, and in a moment Saxon was all\\n\\nsolicitude\\n;\\nbut Dalleszona sent him into breezy\\n\\nlaughter by saying: &quot;Oh, Mr. Chancellor, what\\n\\nshall I do? You are such a wonderful man, so\\n\\nentertaining, that is, I mean such a good lis\\n\\ntener, that I have forgotten to-night is the\\n\\n168\\n\\n\\n\\nToltec Trails\\n\\nRotanza wedding, and we must be going. But\\n\\nI will tell you of ancient Toltec home life,\\n\\nschool and courtship customs as the De Haviland\\n\\nthrums across the ozone seas.&quot;\\n\\nAs they emerged from the palace of treasures\\n\\nto the terraces of the old garden, a scene of\\n\\nsplendor greeted them, that caused Dalleszona to\\n\\nshout for joy while Saxon stood entranced in\\n\\nsilent wonder and admiration.\\n\\nThe setting sun had &quot;dropped below the wes\\n\\ntern mountains, but the wide reaches of Yaki\\n\\nland were covered with a tideless sea of mist of\\n\\ngold. Far, far eastward, even unto the hills of\\n\\nAngustura, shimmering lakes of purple twilight\\n\\nflooded the canyons and terraces of the Cordil\\n\\nleras, and far southward the shores of cloud\\n\\ncontinents rose in mighty facades of molten gold.\\n\\nAs the Mystery Maid rose higher and higher,\\n\\nthe Lastuna Hills and Sahaura Mesa appeared\\n\\n169\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nbathed in bands of heliotrope and veils of saffron,\\n\\nburnt umber, and carnelian, while farther on the\\n\\nMother Sea rolled in billows of flame.\\n\\n&quot;Dalleszona, have you ever seen anything like\\n\\nthis before? I certainly never have. The only\\n\\nscene approaching it for beauty and sublimity\\n\\ncame to me once when I had sailed above and\\n\\nbeyond the Pillars of Hercules and was far out\\n\\nover the desert of Algiers in Africa. Ever since\\n\\nI have planned to sometime sail above the oases\\n\\nand wide-flung sands of the Sahara.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Yes,&quot;\\nshe said, &quot;I have seen this very thing\\n\\nseveral times, but from mountain heights only.\\n\\nBut I am so glad to have you see it with me now,\\n\\nfor you will understand why I love this garden\\n\\nland of the Great Spirit, and so earnestly desire\\n\\nto see with my own eyes the splendor and power\\n\\nof Toltec ideals fully restored.\\n\\n&quot;The crowning glory of these ideals was home\\n\\n170\\n\\n\\n\\nToltec Trails\\n\\nlife, that had the right of way from childhood\\n\\nto old age. Up to sixteen years of age all chil\\n\\ndren were taught and trained in the homes by\\n\\ntheir mothers\\n;\\nand during the years of mother\\n\\nhood the mothers were relieved of all other duties\\n\\nand became simply companions and inspiring\\n\\nlovers for their children. If any signs of physi\\n\\ncal weakness, violent temper or chronic grouch\\n\\nappeared, they were immediately placed under\\n\\nCozmotl influence, with all costs borne by na\\n\\ntional funds.\\n\\n&quot;After sixteen, all sons and daughters were\\n\\nrequired to attend the five great national schools,\\n\\nfirst, at Orizaba, where all boys were required\\n\\nto thoroughly learn grain growing and the girls\\n\\nwere trained in all household duties, cooking,\\n\\nsewing, washing and housekeeping; second, Cho-\\n\\nlula, with fruit growing for the boys, with weav\\n\\ning of tapestries and cloth of all kinds and pat-\\n\\n171\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszor.a\\n\\nterns for the girls; third, Chivela, where mining\\n\\nof precious stones and all metals was followed\\n\\nby the boys and music and painting, if desired,\\n\\nfor both sons and daughters ; fourth, Luzon,\\n\\nbuilding of dwellings, constructive engineering for\\n\\nbusiness and public buildings, roads, canals, etc.,\\n\\nthough only drawing of plans and writing of\\n\\nspecifications was required of the girls; fifth,\\n\\nAlescala, professions, business principles, and\\n\\nespecially conversation, equally open for both.\\n\\nIn the order named they were called Ponzos,\\n\\nTanzos, Montezumas, Rozemmas and Cozmotls,\\n\\nthis latter signifying that in every way they were\\n\\nqualified to be world builders.\\n\\n&quot;Courtship looking towards marriage was ex\\n\\npected and encouraged, but no one was permitted\\n\\nto marry until they had passed through all the\\n\\nschools with good records and the men had built\\n\\na house for family use. All weddings were\\n\\n172\\n\\n\\n\\nToltec Trails\\n\\npublic and could be held at any of the schools\\n\\none day in each month, when the moon fulled ;\\n\\nbut gradually Cholula in the fruit-growing dis\\n\\ntricts of the Tlaxcala Hills, not far from our\\n\\ncapital Puebla, became the popular place for\\n\\nnearly all marriages.\\n\\n&quot;There was constructed in a national park,\\n\\nsurounded by splendid forests, an oval shaped\\n\\namphitheatre with long rows of terraced seats on\\n\\neither side of a sparkling brook, which flowed\\n\\nthrough the center and was spanned by a long\\n\\nbridge just wide enough for two persons to walk\\n\\nalong side by side. One end of this bridge was ?.\\n\\nraised platform, at the other a settee or throne\\n\\nfor the Queen Mother.\\n\\n&quot;To this marriage shrine once each month at\\n\\nthe time of the full moon lovers and sweethearts\\n\\npresented themselves for the wedding rites, the\\n\\nboys on one side, the girls on the other. When\\n173\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nthe great sundial on the raised platform marked\\n\\nthe noontide hour, the boys in heavy swelling\\n\\ntones began chanting,\\n\\nI am coming, O my sweetheart,\\nI have built a home for you,\\n\\n&quot;then the girls in sweet, full-throated music\\n\\nresponded,\\n\\nDo you pledge for aye and ever\\n\\nTo be tender, kind and true?\\n\\nJust how long will you be faithful,\\n\\nCalm or storm or cloud or sun ?\\n\\n&quot;answer by the men,\\n\\nJust as long as grass is growing,\\n\\nJust as long as waters run,\\n\\n174\\n\\n\\n\\nToltec Trails\\n\\nI do pledge to love and honor,\\n\\nEver cherish and adore/\\n\\n&quot;again the girls,\\n\\nNow I m coming, O my lover,\\nI m your sweetheart evermore.\\n\\n&quot;This was repeated twice, then all arose, and\\n\\naccording to numbers, passed to the platform,\\n\\nwhere each lover and sweetheart joined hands\\n\\nand, still chanting softly together, passed along\\n\\nthe bridge over the river of life to receive, each\\n\\nfrom the Queen Mother, a wedding ring set with\\n\\nbirth stones. Beyond her they entered and passed\\n\\nthrough a closed corridor lighted only from above,\\n\\nemblem of light and guidance by the Great\\n\\nSpirit. Passing from the corridor they entered\\n\\nat once a spacious garden, made beautiful with\\n\\nplashing fountains, singing birds, fragrant blos-\\n\\n175\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nsoms and clustering vines, with entertainment\\n\\nhalls and banquet tables, where a splendid repast,\\n\\nprovided by their parents, awaited them. Games\\n\\nand entertainment of various kind, with grand\\n\\nconcert in the evening, closed the wedding day;\\n\\nbut the festivities and amusements might be pro\\n\\nlonged for a week or more if desired by the\\n\\nhappy young people.&quot;\\n\\nThe mist of gold had faded into purple twi\\n\\nlight when the Mystery Maid dropped to the\\n\\nhangar in Truxlan, but the beauty and sweet\\n\\nness of the magic hour could never be forgotten.\\n\\nWhatever may have been in each of their\\n\\nhearts, their lips were silent as they, arm in arm,\\n\\npassed up the rose bordered walk of Dalleszona s\\n\\nhome, until they paused in the fragrant pergola\\n\\nto say good-night, then Saxon spoke:\\n\\n&quot;Dalleszona, this has been the happiest,\\n\\ngladdest day of my life. I never dreamed so\\n\\n176\\n\\n\\n\\nToltec Trails\\n\\nmuch of beauty and fascination, joy and pure\\n\\ndelight, could be crowded into one day, even in\\n\\nthis land so rich with surprising treasure; and 1\\n\\ndo not see how I can ever repaj you for all the\\n\\npleasure you have given to me all through this\\n\\nwonderful, wonderful day.&quot;\\n\\nWith her hand still upon his arm, she said :\\n\\n&quot;I am surely glad the day has brought you great\\n\\npleasure ; but within a few days I am going to\\n\\nask you to take me for another day s sailing of\\n\\nToltec Trails, which I hope will give you more\\n\\nsweetness and delight than to-day could possibly\\n\\nhold.&quot;\\n\\nIt was in his heart, and almost upon his tongue,\\n\\nto ask her if she would go with him down the\\n\\nlong, long trail of life, when a step sounded on\\n\\nthe gravelled walk, and a moment later, his na\\n\\ntional chemist, Cantone Rotanza, sprang up the\\n\\nsteps.\\n\\n177\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nWith an expression of comic dismay on her\\n\\nface, blushing and laughing, Dalleszona said:\\n\\n&quot;Please pardon me, Mr. Saxon, but you have\\n\\ngiven me such a charming time that I had for\\n\\ngotten my promise to attend Cantone s sister s\\n\\nwedding, and did not realize it was so late.\\n\\nPlease excuse me,&quot; and in a breezy moment she\\n\\nwas swept away from him. A few moments\\nlater he heard her trilling a favorite song in her\\n\\nown apartments.\\n\\nFor a few moments he chatted pleasantly with\\n\\nCantone, then passed down the walk, wondering\\n\\nthe while if he had done wisely to appoint so\\n\\nhandsome a young Toltec, national chemist,\\n\\nespecially since the laboratory was next to the\\n\\nDepartment of Welfare, presided over by Dal\\n\\nleszona.\\n\\n&quot;Anyway,&quot; he mused, &quot;she is the most won\\n\\nderful woman I have ever seen. What a world\\n\\n178\\n\\n\\n\\nToltcc Trails\\n\\nthis would be with a race of such women ! After\\n\\nall, any hope for speedy betterment of the world s\\n\\nconditions rests Math women. Men have almost\\n\\nmade a flat failure of government, trying to rule\\n\\nthe nations by force and fear, and fear of force,\\n\\nand have practically bankrupted the world by\\n\\nwar, and mortgaged their children for a hundred\\n\\nyears to pay the costs.\\n\\n&quot;I do wonder what trip Dalleszona has in\\n\\nmind. Where can she possibly plan to go that\\n\\nwe have not already been? Well, I do hope it\\n\\nwill not be many days before I can have another\\n\\nfull day of her infinitely charming companionship,\\n\\nand I m praying it may be before the elections.&quot;\\n\\n179\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\nTHE CHANCELLOR\\n\\nPropelled by the powers of celestial hands, the\\n\\ncycle of ages knows no retrograde movement.\\n\\nFive years of mortal time have slipped from the\\n\\ncalendar of a blood-stained, discontented, strug\\n\\ngling world into the mighty spaces of immortal\\n\\neternity.\\n\\nUnder the wise and just management of Saxon,\\n\\nToltec ideals have grown into world power.\\n\\nThe leaven of democracy, working its way sub\\n\\nlimely on to universal dominion, has been eagerly\\n\\naccepted by all the Central American republics,\\n\\nand under the ancient name of &quot;Chalcedon,&quot; the\\n\\nnew nation, resistless in peace, progress and prom\\n\\nise, holds supreme influence from Panama to the\\n\\nRio Grande.\\n\\n180\\n\\n\\n\\nGlad and happy, the peon millions live in a\\n\\npresent, resplendent with achievement, roseate\\n\\nwith hope for centuries to come.\\n\\nWhen purple twilight broods over this en\\n\\nchanted land without a serf, a servant or a slave,\\n\\nsweet music and songs of happy lovers pulses in\\n\\nmagic rhythm from the Rio Grande to Chagres\\n\\nRiver, and swells with languorous charm from\\n\\nVera Cruz to Mazatlan, while all the nations of\\n\\nthe world look with hungry hearts and yearning\\n\\nadmiration to her bloodless conquests and un\\n\\nconquerable peace.\\n\\nEurope, bolshevic, blood-soaked, bankrupt to\\n\\nthe verge of anarchy, has cleared the Ship of\\n\\nState of every form of royalty and military\\n\\nmania. All that stood for the doctrine of force\\n\\nhas gone the way of the Hohenzollern. The\\n\\naristuckupracy of wealth has given w\\nr\\n\\nay to the\\n\\naristuckupracy of labor; but the seven devils of\\n\\n181\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nSelfishness, Greed, Suspicion, Envy, Jealousy,\\n\\nHate and Revenge are still enthroned in human\\n\\nhearts. The altruistic ideals of the Mighty\\n\\nGalilean have been rejected, while the helpless,\\n\\nalmost hopeless millions watch and long for\\n\\nleaders with heart and conscience committed to\\n\\ntruth and justice, with courage to blaze the trail\\n\\nto universal brotherhood. But a flaming star of\\n\\nhope has appeared in the person of Casimer of\\n\\nPoland. A magnetic statesman of splendid pre\\nsence, he has inspired his countrymen with an\\n\\ncient heroism, and a League of Peace, formed\\n\\nwith Russian Jews, is thundering a mighty\\n\\ncrusade for justice and equity over a blood-\\n\\ndrenched continent, and the dawn of a better day\\n\\nalready illumines the governmental skies of war-\\n\\ncursed millions. Inspired and guided by the\\n\\nsplendor and power of Toltec ideals, enthused\\n\\nby the policy and program of Saxon, who now\\n\\n182\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Chancellor\\n\\nholds peaceful but irresistible power, Casimer is\\n\\nsurely leading the European hosts into Life,\\n\\nLiberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.\\n\\nIn Asia, too, the spirit and power of democ\\n\\nracy is leading grandly on. The mighty spirit\\n\\nof India s ancient days Kamadeva has awak\\n\\nened the sleeping soul of Hindustan and China\\n\\nto life and action. English dominion is ended\\n\\nforever. Japan has received an ultimatum, &quot;Live\\n\\nin peace or die in war.&quot; &quot;Decency or extermina\\n\\ntion. Sink your battleships and disband your\\n\\narmy, or we will do it for you.&quot; &quot;It s up to you.&quot;\\n\\nThis old world will no longer tolerate cesspools\\n\\nthat breed war germs and military microbes.\\n\\n&quot;Human as well as material sanitation is the\\n\\nword.&quot;\\n\\nEven now eight hundred millions of human\\n\\nbeings are pressing on in bloodless conquest of\\n\\nabundant resources of the world s greatest con-\\n\\n183\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\ntinent, and the spiritual forces of India, which\\n\\nhave hitherto dissipated their unmatched powers\\n\\nin dreaming dreams, interpreting horoscopes, hyp\\n\\nnotizing progress and consulting ouija boards and\\n\\nfamiliar spirits, has appeared incarnate in altruis\\n\\ntic ideals, and long centuries of caste and gloom\\n\\nare giving way to tolerance and sanity.\\n\\nIn the United States the religious forces, long\\n\\nenchained by &quot;a form of godliness, but denying\\n\\nthe powef thereof&quot; (Sacrifice), is swiftly turning\\n\\nto culture of heart and conscience rather than\\n\\nbrains and business as the supreme aim. But the\\n\\npleasure seekers and &quot;joy riders&quot; have degene\\n\\nrated into a race of nicotine, cocaine and mor\\n\\nphine fiends that threatens social, economic and\\n\\ngovernmental chaos.\\n\\nSouth American republics, startled and charmed\\n\\nby the dazzling success of Chalcedon, watch,\\n\\nand wonder whether a nation can really exist\\n\\n184\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Chancellor\\n\\nwithout bullets, bloodshed, moral corruption,\\n\\nspiritual degeneracy and chronic revolution.\\n\\n&quot;These things always have been. We believe\\n\\nthey always will be.&quot; &quot;You will have to show\\n\\nus.&quot;\\n\\nSo stands the world after six years of attempted\\n\\nreconstruction at the hands of politicians and\\n\\ntime-servers.\\n\\nMeanwhile, national elections are on for\\n\\nChalcedon, and the whole world, thrilled with\\n\\nthe mighty contest of &quot;World-changing Ideals,&quot;\\n\\nis paying undivided attention to the fiercely con\\n\\ntested campaign.\\n\\nIn ancient days Toltec leadership had always\\n\\nbeen hereditary, and for long centuries was con\\n\\nfined to the House of Iximaga. The present\\n\\nIximaga, a man of tremendous personality, pos\\n\\nsessed by the highest order of statesmanship, had\\n\\nappointed Saxon to supreme authority. Saxon\\n\\n185\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nhad banked heavily on Iximaga s wisdom, and in\\n\\nall matters of national moment there had been\\n\\nabsolute accord, save this one, the manner of\\n\\nchoosing his successor. However, Saxon had\\n\\ncarried the point without bitterness ; the campaign\\n\\nwas at \\\\vhite heat and election day near at hand.\\n\\nSaxon had refrained from taking any part in the\\n\\ncampaign, stoutly holding he was chancellor for\\n\\nall rather than for any faction or party, that\\n\\ngovernment simply was good business, and so far\\n\\nIximaga had not spoken publicly. But the third\\n\\nnight before the day set for balloting, there was\\n\\nto be a final gathering at the capitol of influential\\n\\ndelegations from every province, and Iximaga had\\n\\nconsented to speak.\\n\\nSaxon s chief rival was Cantone Rotanza, na\\n\\ntional chemist, a brilliant, magnetic, pure-blood\\n\\nyoung Toltec and closely related to the Hogan\\n\\nof Iximaga.\\n\\n186\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Chancellor\\n\\nCantone was acknowledged leader of educa\\n\\ntional forces, and had been a tremendous factor\\n\\nin the upbuilding of the nation. Moreover,\\n\\nCantone and Saxon had always worked together\\n\\nas friends, though it was well known that the\\n\\nhandsome, popular chemist was a welcome visitor\\n\\nat the Hogan of Iximaga and an ardent wor\\n\\nshipper at the shrine of Dalleszona.\\n\\nImmediately following the victory of the Tol-\\n\\ntecs in the Valley of Death, there had been a\\n\\nweek-long fiesta of national proportions, and at\\n\\nthe closing fandango, Cantone and Dalleszona\\n\\nhad been conspicuous for their attention and de\\n\\nvotion to each other and h?d won the first honors\\n\\nas beautiful and graceful dancers. In fact, the\\n\\nbeauty and brilliance of the couple had won\\n\\nuniversal admiration, and there was an able-\\n\\nbodied rumor that the Hogan of Iximaga would\\n\\nclaim relationship with the new chancellor.\\n\\n187\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nOf course Saxon could not know exactly how\\n\\nmuch progress Cantone had made in the graces\\n\\nof Dalleszona, but he did know that the chan\\n\\ncellorship would be but the ashes of Dead Sea\\n\\nfruit to his soul if he failed to win Dalleszona.\\n\\nTrue, they were the best of friends; together in\\n\\nbusiness or social life every day she had been the\\n\\ninspirer of most of his success, had always held\\n\\ninfinite charm for him, and commanded ab\\n\\nsolutely the love and admiration of his heart and\\n\\nbrain\\n;\\nbut his soul had never felt sure enough\\n\\nof her love to ask her to be his wife.\\n\\nAbout a week before the election day she came\\n\\nto him early in the morning and said :\\n\\n&quot;Ben Igo, I wish you would order the Mys\\n\\ntery Maid and take me to Lastuna Ford on the\\n\\nHermosillo Road to-day,&quot; and, when he hesitated,\\n\\nhad added, &quot;The terrible memories of that place\\n\\nhave been a living nightmare all these years, and\\n\\n188\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Chancellor\\n\\nuntil to-day I have never been able to gain my\\nown consent to return there; but to-day I feel\\n\\nI can go, and I lost a throat pin there that I\\n\\nhope to recover, for it has come down from my\\n\\ngrandmothers for centuries.&quot;\\n\\nShe had never before called him by his first\\n\\nname. For fifteen years he had been known as\\n\\n&quot;Ben Saxon&quot;; but his mother had always called\\n\\nhim\\n&quot;Igo,&quot;\\n\\nand the old name from the lips of\\n\\nDalleszona thrilled him almost beyond control.\\n\\nStill, some imperative business at the seventh\\n\\ntreasure compelled his presence there, and he had\\n\\nfelt required to say he could not take her to\\n\\nLastuna, and the beautiful eyes were full of dis\\n\\nappointment that was misery for him, as she\\n\\nturned away. All day her look of pleading was\\n\\nwith him as he wended his way through the\\n\\nunderground mazes of the seventh treasure and\\n\\n189\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nworked out a peaceful settlement of mining\\n\\nproblems.\\n\\nOn his return he planned to see Dalleszona\\nand arrange for the trip to Lastuna, but before\\n\\nhe could look for her was told that she had gone\\n\\nwith Cantone to attend some chemical laboratory\\n\\nexperiments in Central American provinces.\\n\\nSaxon knew his governmental methods and\\n\\nsuccess had been entirely satisfactory to the\\n\\nToltecs, Mexicans and Anhuacs, all of wrhom\\n\\nhad been, under his personal approval, called to\\n\\nthe right of franchise. But the campaign was\\n\\nbeing waged along racial lines. &quot;We want a\\n\\nchancellor of our own blood&quot; was the slogan of\\n\\nCantone and his followers. &quot;Saxon is all right.\\n\\nHe has been loyal and wonderful in his devotion\\n\\nto Toltec ideals, but he is a Gringo .&quot; &quot;Chal-\\n\\ncedon has blood and brain to manage her own\\n\\naffairs.&quot; &quot;Chalcedon for Chalcedonians&quot; was\\n\\n190\\n\\n\\n\\nthe magic word from the Rio Grande to the\\n\\nChagres River.\\n\\nCantone had manufactured an inflammable\\n\\nfilm that spelled the sentence as it burned, and\\n\\nthese films had been dropped from airplanes at\\n\\nevery schoolhouse in the realm, till the fiery\\n\\ncreed had literally blazed from storm clouds and\\n\\nflamed on velvet skies at night.\\n\\nThis thing had gone on for weeks before the\\n\\nSaxon supporters had been able to match the\\n\\nfilm; but, when they did, they filled the heavens\\n\\nwith fiery squadrons bearing an illuminated flag\\n\\nof the nation, inscribed: &quot;Saxon has given us\\n\\npeace and life. Follow him, and the world is\\n\\nours. What more do you want?&quot;\\n\\nThe newness and stupendous possibilities of\\n\\nthe fascinating doctrine of a living, growing\\n\\nworld life, pulsing with peaceful progress and\\n\\nimperishable glory, set a new standard for pa-\\n\\n191\\n\\n\\n\\nDallcszona\\n\\ntriotic desire and heroic action and the Saxon\\n\\nboosters were gaining in numbers and zeal every\\n\\nwhere.\\n\\nIn an attempt to check the tremendous tide,\\n\\nCantone had made a personal visit to the former\\n\\nCentral American provinces, and Dallcszona ha\\n\\ngone with him. Cantone s followers did not\\n\\nclaim that she had spoken publicly in favor of his\\n\\ncandidacy, but the fact that she had appeared at\\n\\npublic gatherings with him was ground for\\n\\nclaiming she desired his election. Both sides\\n\\nfreely admitted Dalleszona could influence more\\n\\nvotes than any other person in the nation, and\\n\\ncould easily be elected chancellor herself if she\\n\\ndesired the place.\\n\\nWhen the night of the closing rally came,\\n\\nIximaga was not physically able to be present,\\n\\nbut sent Dalleszona as his substitute. Saxon s\\n\\nsoul was heavy with doubt and his heart full of\\n\\n192\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Chancellor\\n\\nmisgivings. If Dalleszona should speak for Can-\\n\\ntone, undoubtedly her heart and hand would go\\n\\nto him in marriage. He could bear easily the\\n\\nlos;s of the chancellorship, if he still had hope of\\n\\nwinning Dalleszona ; but, if both were lost, all\\n\\nfuture years must be a barren desert, storm-\\n\\nbeaten, horror-blackened, desolate.\\n\\nHowever, he ascended the platform with Can-\\n\\ntone and Dalleszona, and spoke words of welcome\\n\\nand congratulation to the assembled thousands,\\n\\nnot a word for his own candidacy, platform nor\\n\\npolicies, but an irresistible appeal for the dignity\\n\\nand purity of the franchise, and the necessity of\\n\\nevery voter, male and female, casting a con\\n\\nscientious ballot.\\n\\nJust at the moment of closing his address, and\\n\\npresenting Cantone, imperative summons came for\\n\\nhis immediate presence at the refinery at South-\\n\\nrown, and when he returned, some hours later,\\n\\n193\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nthe great rally had passed into history, and, with\\n\\nout knowledge of that epoch marking session, he\\n\\nsought the privacy of his own apartments.\\n\\nCantone made a powerful appeal for &quot;Home\\n\\nrule, home life and racial integrity.&quot; &quot;We have\\n\\na matchless land, marvellous prosperity. We are\\na great nation, doing great things. Let us be\\n\\ncontent. Why should we be worried over trou\\nbled conditions beyond the seas, or burden our\\n\\nselves with entanglements there ? An all-wise\\n\\nCreator has set the bounds of our habitation and\\n\\nwalled us in by protecting seas. The whole\\n\\nworld for business and profit, pleasure and travel,\\n\\nbut hands off the social and governmental policies\\n\\nof the Old World. Chalcedon for Chalcedo-\\n\\nnians.&quot;\\n\\nDalleszona had travelled eight hundred miles\\n\\nthat day over vibrant seas and swinging lands,\\n\\nbut, when Cantone ceased speaking and left the\\n\\n194\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Chancellor\\n\\nplatform, she stood before the expectant thou\\n\\nsands, the incarnation of mental and spiritual\\n\\npower without a sign of physical weariness.\\n\\n&quot;Toltecs, Tezcucans, Anhuacs, fellow Ameri\\n\\ncans and brothers, all ! The House of Iximaga\\n\\nstands for universal brotherhood and world life.\\n\\nDuring six milleniums of history the race of\\n\\nhuman beings has plunged on, bathed in human\\n\\nblood, blasted by racial prejudice, blighted by\\n\\nselfishness, dwarfed by littleness and cursed by\\n\\nwar. The Toltecs have well-nigh eliminated\\n\\nselfishness, abolished war, inaugurated permanent\\n\\npeace. Come! Let us abandon little narrow\\n\\nness, forget racial prejudice and inscribe upon the\\n\\nvery heavens above us universal tolerance and\\n\\nworld life. Ben Igo Saxon was born in the\\n\\nUnited States of America, but his ancestors are\\n\\npure blood, direct descendants of Japheth, full\\n\\n195\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nbrother to our mighty progenitor, the illustrious\\n\\nShem.\\n\\n&quot;I beg of you follow Saxon s rugged, flaming\\n\\npathway, the hilltop road that meets the sky\\n\\nand leads us boldly faring against the very roof\\n\\nof things. Take this upward step. Vote for the\\n\\nman with heart and conscience, brain and spirit,\\n\\nlarge enough and pure enough, loyal enough and\\n\\nwise enough to lead us into the new era, the\\n\\nnew order, of world life and eternal progression.&quot;\\n\\nThe next morning she sent a messenger for\\n\\nSaxon. When he arrived, she said, &quot;Ben Igo, can\\n\\nyou take me to-day to the Lastuna Ford of the\\n\\nHermosillo Road?&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Yes,\\nI can and will. I had arranged to go\\n\\nwith Cantone to witness a demonstration by him\\n\\nof a new process, tempering gold as well as cop\\n\\nper by means of mineral paints extracted from\\n\\nmetal bearing ores. He assures me that he has\\n\\n196\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Chancellor\\n\\nproduced an acid which transmutes the primary\\n\\ncolors of the rainbow from nature s laboratories,\\n\\nand can reproduce the ancient Tyrian and Vene\\n\\ntian dyes. He surely showed me mirrors of\\n\\ntranscendent clearness equal in reflecting power\\n\\nto molten gold. I believe it to be the most in\\n\\nteresting and far-reaching discovery of modern\\n\\ntimes\\n;\\nbut your wishes have the right of way,\\n\\nand we will sail immediately for Lastuna Hills.&quot;\\n\\nThey had not been in the air but a few minutes\\n\\nwhen Saxon turned to Dalleszona and said :\\n\\n&quot;Why do you call me Ben Igo, and what did\\n\\nyou tell the voters last evening?&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Why do you care to know?&quot;\\n\\nDon t worry about the Why please, for\\n\\nreally I must know.&quot;\\n\\nDalleszona laughed in a merry, happy way and\\n\\nparried by asking what had called him to the\\n\\nrefinery.\\n\\n197\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\n&quot;No, you cannot sidetrack me by asking about\\n\\nrefineries. If you care to save human, life, please\\n\\nanswer my question now.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Suppose I don t. What will you do?&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Well, I might do a lot of things. What I\\n\\nought to do is head this Mystery Maid for San\\n\\nDiego and wreck her in the Harbor of the Sun .&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Would that be a wise thing for a man to do\\n\\nwho is about to be chosen chancellor of the\\n\\ngreatest nation in the world?&quot;\\n\\nSaxon wondered what this new mood, half\\n\\nserious, half playful, might mean ; but her face\\n\\nwas so radiantly beautiful and this upper air so\\n\\nfull of sweetness and charm that he only said,\\n\\n&quot;Perhaps what you said will elect the other\\n\\nfellow.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Why don t you ask Cantone about that?\\n\\nReally I believe he will remember what I said\\n\\nbetter than I do, and, besides, day after to-\\n\\n198\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Chancellor\\n\\nmorrow will be election day, and surely you can\\n\\nwait that long for an answer.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Very well. How about the other question?\\n1 am more interested in that than about the\\n\\nchancellorship.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Careful ! Attend to your flying. The motor\\n\\nseems a bit weak. That fog bank will wreck us\\n\\nif you don t watch out. What is the matter\\n\\nwith the De Haviland to-day, anyway? We are\\nnot making over seventy miles an hour, and we\\n\\nought to make a hundred if we are to come back\\n\\nby the lake and forum and arrive at home in time\\n\\nfor me to finish that picture I m so hurried for.&quot;\\n&quot;What picture is that? I did not know you\\n\\nhad opened a studio.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;The picture of the new chancellor. I prom\\n\\nised myself to have it ready for his birthday next\\n\\nMonday.&quot;\\n\\nMonday would be Saxon s birthday, and he\\n\\n199\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nhappened to know it would be Cantone s birth\\n\\nday, too.\\n\\nA glance at Dalleszona s smiling face told him\\n\\nshe, too, knew of the double birthday, and she\\n\\nhad purposely introduced the picture to puzzle\\n\\nhim.\\n\\n&quot;How do you know that I am going to bring\\n\\nyou back by the lake?&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Because I m not going to answer your first\\n\\nquestion until wre get back to the lake. Also\\n\\nthere is a famous fortune teller there for a week,\\n\\nand I mean to have our fortunes told. You just\\n\\nmust take me there, and she can tell you about\\n\\nthe chancellorship.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Do you promise to answer my question if I\\n\\nbring you to the lake?&quot;\\n\\nThe long lashes veiled the wondrous eyes that\\n\\nAvould not meet his own as she said, &quot;Yes, Ben\\n\\nIgo, I will answer your question at the lake.&quot;\\n\\n200\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Chancellor\\n\\nAnd somehow her manner of answering brought\\n\\ngreat consolation to his heart, and. the s\\\\veetness\\n\\nof a mighty hope possessed his soul.\\n\\nProbably coming events, sometimes near, some\\n\\ntimes far, are foreshadowed to the soul. Be that\\n\\nas it may, the De Haviland had scarcely entered\\n\\nthe storm cloud, ere Saxon was sharply reminded\\n\\nof Dalleszona s half-earnest, half-playful remark,\\n\\n&quot;That storm cloud will wreck us if you don t\\n\\nwatch&quot;\\n;\\n\\nfor electrical currents such as he had\\n\\nnever before contended with were already pulling\\n\\nwith appalling and well-nigh resistless power.\\n\\nOne of the steel spring guy wires supporting\\n\\nthe extreme outer end of the top left wing gave\\n\\nway, and, swinging backward, smote the wing\\n\\nwith startling crash. Saxon knew it might split\\n\\nthe wing and lead to accident in the strong,\\n\\nelemental currents. But, if it should swing for\\n\\nward and be caught in the propeller blades,\\n\\n201\\n\\n\\n\\nDallesxona\\n\\nnothing short of a miracle could prevent the\\n\\nmachine from dropping swiftly to utter destruc\\n\\ntion. He could fasten the spring in a few mo\\n\\nments, but was afraid to trust the steering wheel\\n\\nto Dalleszona in the terrific force of the storm.\\n\\nThen Saxon learned something of the courage\\n\\nand daring of a great woman s spirit.\\n\\nTaking a pair of pliers and stretcher, she\\n\\nclimbed up the hatchway and swiftly worked her\\n\\nway to the farthest edge of the great wring, caught\\n\\nthe whirling spring, drew it tense, made it secure,\\n\\nand returned in safety to Saxon s side. At the\\n\\nsame moment he felt the loss of power in the\\n\\nengine. Something was interfering with the fuel\\n\\nfeed. Then he opened the feed line from the\\n\\nemergency tank, and instantly realized with sick\\n\\nened soul that it was empty. Someone had\\n\\ntampered with the De Haviland, for he had filled\\n\\nthe emergency tank the evening before, but had\\n\\n202\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Chancellor\\n\\nnot used it on the trip to the refinery. Mean\\n\\ntime the machine was dropping and pitching in a\\n\\nfrightful way, and soon must be entirely beyond\\n\\ncontrol.\\n\\nDalleszona lifted the trap door, slipped through\\n\\nto the chassis, found a loosened union on the\\n\\ngasoline line, connected it, and Saxon felt the\\n\\nrenewal of power as they shot out of the cloud\\n\\ninto sunlight at terrific speed in a nose spin to\\n\\nward jagged cliffs.\\n\\nIn the confusion and darkness of the cloud\\n\\nhe had not noticed Dalleszona s action, and the\\n\\ndoor, fastened by a spring catch from above,\\n\\nprevented her return. But when the machine\\n\\nwas again under control, he turned, to find her\\n\\nseat vacant: his brain seemed paralyzed, though\\n\\nby instinct, perhaps, he guided the machine to\\n\\nsafe landing. As the Mystery Maid came to\\n\\n203\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nanchor, everything went black, though his tense\\n\\ngrip still held the wheel.\\n\\nWhen he recovered consciousness, Dalleszona s\\n\\nwhite face was very close to his own, and she\\n\\nheld his hands in closest grasp as she laughingly\\n\\ntold him how she had connected the feed pipe,\\n\\nthen swung from the frame, until the chassis\\n\\ntrariled the chaparral, and, by some miracle, she\\n\\nhad been thrown, unhurt, into a heavy bunch of\\n\\npampas plumes.\\n\\nSaxon gazed upon her radiant face speechless,\\n\\nuntil a slow smile played upon the tender lips,\\n\\nand she shyly said, &quot;Ben Igo, will you take me\\n\\nto the lake and forum as we return from Lastuna\\n\\nFord?&quot;\\n\\nThe answer and look he gave her brought\\n\\nscarlet flame to her face and neck ; but, springing\\n\\nto her feet, she exclaimed, &quot;We must be on our\\n\\n204\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Chancellor\\n\\nway, Ben Igo, or we will have no time for that\\n\\nfortune teller s vision.&quot;\\n\\nOne hundred miles in seventy minutes, and\\n\\nthe Mystery Maid anchored in safety beside\\n\\nLastuna s sparkling waters.\\n\\nThe glen where the tents had stood was just\\n\\nthe same ; but flood waters had pushed the\\n\\nchannel of the stream close to the lonely grave,\\n\\nthen thrown a boulder reef that made it safe\\n\\nforevermore.\\n\\nAround the turn of the jagged rocks, where\\n\\nthe bodies of the bandits had been buried, the\\n\\nwaters had swept everything clean to bedrock.\\n\\nLong and carefully they searched the crevices\\n\\nof the granite wall where the girls crouched\\n\\nduring the battle, and at last the throat pin was\\n\\nfound. It was a priceless emerald in setting of\\n\\nbeaten gold, wondrously engraved, and Dalles-\\n\\nzona s joy was beyond measure.\\n\\n205\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\n&quot;For eighteen hundred years,&quot; she said, &quot;no\\n\\ndaughter of the House of Iximaga has come to\\n\\nher wedding-day without this pin at her throat.&quot;\\n\\nThen, with a world of mischief in her laughing\\n\\neyes, she added, &quot;I may need it soon.&quot; And\\n\\nSaxon dared not to ask her any other word lest\\n\\nher answer crush his new-born hopes.\\n\\nJust above the forum at the lake lies a broad\\n\\nmesa that served as training base for the Toltec\\n\\naerial merchant marine. Here they left the\\n\\nMystery Maid and, descending broad marble\\n\\nstairs to the water s edge, entered a small motor\\n\\nlaunch, for the luncheon Dalleszona s own hands\\n\\nhad prepared.\\n\\nUnder Saxon s own personal supervision, the\\n\\ntemple, court and amphitheater had been fully\\n\\nrestored, and lay like a magnificent jewel in the\\n\\nvale on the mountain s breast.\\n\\nAfter a happy, never-to-be-forgotten hour on\\n\\n206\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Chancellor\\n\\nthe tideless lake, they passed from the Lotus\\n\\nBloom and waters of Lethe, through the great\\n\\ntemple and beyond its courts to a natural grotto\\n\\nin the rear of the amphitheater.\\n\\nIn some ancient age the grotto had been en\\n\\nlarged by human hands, and one wall, built of\\n\\nvarious colored flints, had been fused by intense\\n\\nheat, until the whole wall appeared to be fretted\\n\\nwith all manner of precious stones, and, dazzling\\n\\nlight falling upon it, one involuntarily thought\\n\\nof that city whose foundations are garnished with\\n\\nall manner of gems, whose Maker and Builder\\n\\nis God. A rose-pink onyx partition had been\\nthrown almost across the grotto, dividing it into\\n\\ntwo good-sized rooms, with an open corridor lead\\n\\ning to the second room. In the first room, dimly\\n\\nlighted, was an alcove, which afforded view of\\n\\nexit from the trance room. Originally used as\\n\\na rest room for speakers in the forum, now it\\n\\n207\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nwas given over to the use of clairvoyants, fortune\\n\\ntellers and all sorts of people gifted with any or\\n\\nall occult forces. Here, now, Torclez, most\\n\\nbeautiful and brilliant woman of all Central\\n\\nAmerica, professional destiny artist, dealt in\\n\\npast and futures, of all colors, brands and degrees\\n\\nof excellence, and numbered among her votaries\\n\\nnot only peons and notables of Chalcedon, but\\n\\ncelebrities and millionaires from everywhere.\\n\\nThe range and register of Torclez s excursions\\n\\ninto either past or future seemed limitless. Des\\n\\ntinies of four and twelve cylinders, submarine and\\n\\nairplane destinies of high voltage and persistent\\n\\namperes, ranging in price from a few pesos to\\n\\nthousands, were disposed of, according to zeal,\\n\\nenthusiasm and financial ability of the candidates\\n\\nior occult wisdom and information.\\n\\nUsually her parlors and reception rooms were\\n\\n208\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Chancellor\\n\\ncrowded with beauty and chivalry, but to-day s\\n\\nrush was about over.\\n\\n&quot;Please be seated. Not long to wait. Only\\n\\none client ahead of\\nyou,&quot;\\n\\nsaid the attendant, and\\n\\nSaxon and Dalleszona took cushioned seats in the\\n\\nshadowy alcove. Saxon had little if any faith in\\n\\nthe so-called marvelous visions of this revealer\\n\\nof secrets, and would much have preferred the\\n\\nafternoon alone with Dalleszona. But she really\\n\\nwished to test Torclez s powers, and Saxon\\n\\nwould have gone to Hades, if need be, to please\\n\\nDalleszona to-day. However, the time in the\\n\\nalcove was not entirely without compensation, for\\n\\nthey had to converse in whispers, which compelled\\n\\nthem to sit close together, and the waiting period\\n\\nseemed short.\\n\\nSuddenly a shadow appeared on the corridor\\n\\nwall, and a moment later Cantone, with elastic\\n\\n209\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nstep and smiling face, passed from the destiny\\n\\nrevealer s room.\\n\\n&quot;Pardon me, Ben Igo,&quot; said Dalleszona with\\n\\na smothered laugh, &quot;now s your chance. I ll\\n\\nexcuse you for a moment if you wish to ask Can-\\n\\ntone about my speech at the rally. I m sure he\\nknows just what you desire to learn, and possibly\\n\\nhe could give some interesting data on the chan\\n\\ncellorship. But do be brief and don t leave me\\n\\nhere alone long.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;No, thank you. I greatly prefer to receive\\n\\ninformation on that meeting first hand from you,&quot;\\n\\nbut deep in his soul he would have given much\\n\\nto know just what the brilliant and charming\\n\\nTorclez had told Cantone concerning the chan\\n\\ncellorship and to-morrow s elections. Also he\\n\\ncould not help wondering how much influence\\n\\nthis fair enchantress might have with voters in\\n\\nthe southern provinces. And, too, if she were\\n\\n210\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Chancellor\\n\\na friend of Dalleszona, possibly she really knew\\n\\nsome things that could be of great comfort to\\n\\nCantone. So he covered his anxiety by asking:\\n\\n&quot;What do you know about this Torclez? Have\\n\\nyou ever met her?&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Yes, before I went to school at Hermosillo\\n\\nshe and I were good friends for a year at Oaxaca,\\n\\nand I saw her again several times when I toured\\n\\nthe southern provinces with Cantone during the\\n\\ncampaign. She certainly is the most fascinating\\n\\nand wonderful woman I have ever met, and\\n\\nsurely is possessed of some strange gift. You\\n\\nknow how matter-of-fact my father is, and even\\n\\nhe admits that Torclez possesses some strong,\\n\\nunearthly power not accounted for by human\\n\\nwisdom.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Then you really believe there is something\\n\\nin this soothsayer s, magician s claims?&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Yes, I know there is, or used to be. For in\\n\\n211\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nancient times the Elohim of the Shemites warned\\n\\ntheir wise men, and indeed all classes, to not have\\n\\nanything to do writh wizards and necromancers,\\nand divine wisdom never warns against imaginary\\n\\nnothings.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Well, if there is divine prohibition against\\n\\nthem, why do you seek to play the game?&quot;\\n&quot;The prohibitions were never laid upon my\\n\\npeople, and may have been purely arbitrary or\\n\\nof local value. Still, to tell the whole truth,\\n\\nMr. Chancellor, I am not seeking any informa\\n\\ntion concerning the future, and will confess to\\n\\njust a freak curiosity to see how much of the\\n\\npast she can reveal. You know it is the pursuit\\nof the mysterious that furnishes most of the\\n\\nthrills of life, from human standpoint.&quot;\\n\\nJust then the attendent summoned them to the\\n\\nsanctum sanctorum of the Nicaraguan enchant\\n\\nress.\\n\\n212\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Chancellor\\n\\nAs Dalleszona s hand rested upon his arm, he\\n\\ncould feel her trembling, and somehow his heart\\n\\ncried out for his mother s presence, and he\\n\\nmentally resolved to call for her if opportunity\\n\\noffered.\\n\\nPerhaps in all the world, in all ages, human\\n\\neyes have never rested upon a more wonderful\\n\\nsetting than that which Saxon and Dalleszona\\n\\nnow looked upon. On a throne carved from\\n\\npurest chalcedony, decorated with ribbon agate\\n\\nand satin spar, half-sitting half-reclining, upon\\n\\nsilken cushions, Torclez awaited them. Imme\\n\\ndiately in front of her was a table of burnished\\n\\ngold, studded with priceless gems. Just across\\n\\nthe table was a dais of tiger eye, with arms and\\n\\nback of alter-rail design chiseled from azurite and\\n\\nbordered with golden sapphires and pigeon-blood\\n\\nrubies.\\n\\nTo this seat Torcles beckoned them with jew-\\n213\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nelled hands, smiling face sweet as a praying angel\\n\\nand eyes of lambent flame.\\n\\n&quot;Bless my soul! It is my school-girl chum,\\nDalleszona. Sweetheart, how came you here?\\n\\nThis morning I saw you swinging from the\\n\\nchassis of an airplane, hurled like a thunderbolt\\n\\nof Thor from a storm cloud. How did you\\nescape, and what brings you here? I see, too,\\n\\nthat you have the wedding pin of the Iximagas\\n\\nat your throat. Tell me, girl, what is on your\\n\\nheart to-day? What blessing do you crave from\\n\\nthe spirit world? Or may be you have sweet\\n\\nsecrets to share with me.&quot;\\n\\nBlushing, laughing, Dallaszona answered : &quot;I\\n\\nwished my friend here to meet you, and together\\nwe want you to take us to the lands of the unseen,\\n\\nwrhere we mortals may not go without a guide.\\n\\nBut, understand, we want only the past. No\\n\\n214\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Chancellor\\n\\ndealings in futures. Time enough for that when\\n\\nthey are revealed by enrolling years.&quot;\\n\\nThey were seated close to the artificial parti\\n\\ntion of the grotto, facing what seemed a solid\\n\\nwall of masonry a short distance beyond Torclez.\\n\\n&quot;How fortunate you are, Dalleszona. To-day\\n\\nof all days is the most favorable, for to-night\\n\\nthe Aztec moon fulls, and the people of all lands,\\n\\nall realms beneath yon dome where God s own\\n\\nhands hath hung the stars, will be sailing the\\n\\nuncharted seas watching for beacon lights on the\\n\\nshores of time. Your people on the other side,\\n\\nknowing of your adventure in the clouds this\\n\\nmorning, will bring you messages of infinite joy.&quot;\\n\\nSuddenly the lights dissolved into darkness.\\n\\nThe air became heavy with perfume from unseen\\n\\ncensors. A large disc on the opposite wall rolled\\n\\naway, and obliquely across a jewelled corridor\\n\\nfrom unseen source fell the pathway of a brighter\\n\\n215\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nlight than they had ever seen. At the same mo\\n\\nment a sense of rhythm as of sandalled footsteps\\n\\npulsed upon the air. Every faculty of soul and\\n\\nspirit was so responsive to the sense of tre\\n\\nmendous mystery, that instinctively Saxon took\\n\\nDalleszona s hand, and found her pulse only a\\n\\ntrifle above normal\\n;\\nbut the blood was pounding\\n\\nto her very ringer tips, and her eyes widened with\\n\\ninfinite wonder and literally blazed with im\\n\\nmortal fire, and he realized he had been per\\n\\nmitted to look upon the very soul of this great\\n\\nwoman as she approached, undaunted, the border\\n\\nland of mighty spiritual scenes.\\n\\nAn instant later the intangible, immaterial,\\n\\nbut substantial forms of a man and woman\\n\\nentered the path of light, and Saxon felt swept\\n\\nfrom all moorings as he instantly recognized the\\n\\ntransfigured forms of Dalleszona s father and\\n\\nmother. The spirit body was an absolute perfect\\n\\n216\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Chancellor\\n\\ncounterpart of their physical bodies as they must\\n\\nhave been in the zenith of fleshly power, ere the\\n\\ncorroding hand of time and age had touched\\n\\nthem. But more wonderful than form and\\n\\nfeature was the effect of the marvelous light\\n\\nupon the spiritual forces. It was an X-ray of\\n\\nmind and heart, conscience and will purpose and\\n\\naspiration. As the vision progressed, not only\\n\\nthe thoughts and deeds, but the motives and de\\n\\nsires of body, soul and spirit of this splendid\\n\\ncouple stood out in bold relief. Swiftly as thought\\n\\ntravels, Saxon was startled and overwhelmed\\n\\nwith possible results if this strange revealing light\\n\\nwere brought into every-day affairs of mortals,\\n\\nso that each might know the thoughts, motives\\n\\nand desires of all, and all of each, and truly\\n\\nhe wondered if he would be willing to give the\\n\\nworld each day an X-ray of his own conscience,\\n\\nmental and moral processes. Would the race\\n\\n217\\n\\n\\n\\nreform, or become moral outcasts like the lepers\\n\\nof olden time? Who could say.\\nAs her parents passed from sight, two other\\n\\nforms appeared, and Dalleszona whispered, &quot;My\\n\\ngrandfather and mother.&quot; But in their case, all\\n\\nthat had been bad or looked in the way of evil\\n\\nwas blank, while all the good they had done or\\n\\ndesired to do and could not, by reason of\\n\\nuntoward surroundings or lack of ability, were\\n\\ngiven fullest credit. But the young couple shud\\n\\ndered as they realized the frequency and length\\n\\nof the blanks.\\n\\nSwiftly the long procession passed, winding\\n\\ndown from the summit of far-off ages, climbing,\\n\\nclimbing, ever climbing to the sun bright realms\\n\\nof a new heaven and new earth, wherein only\\n\\nrighteousness dwells.\\n\\nThen Torclez spoke: &quot;Dalleszona, you wished\\n\\nto know something of your past. Behold now,\\n\\n218\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Chancellor\\n\\nyour ancestors for thirty generations, fifteen\\n\\nhundred years. They are your past, and you are\\n\\nwhat they have made. Will you pass the record\\n\\non, undefiled? Your thoughts of to-day will be\\n\\nthe flesh and blood of to-morrow.&quot; Transfixed\\n\\nand awed, but with throbbing heart and swinging\\n\\nbrain, Dalleszona watched the long lines of an\\n\\ncestral spirits pass the revealing light until all\\n\\nwere gone and only silence possessed the corridor.\\n\\nSaxon, too, was thrilled by the transcendent im\\n\\nmortal power of family life, as he beheld this\\n\\nHouse of Iximaga through fifteen hundred years\\n\\nof mortal time, leaders in flush and power of\\n\\nprogress; leaders calm and steadfast in centuries\\n\\nof defeat\\n;\\n\\nleaders patient and brave through\\n\\nsuffering and sorrows untold ; leaders with un\\n\\ntainted blood pulsing through arteries and veins,\\n\\nunder stress of mighty temptation ; great men and\\n\\nwomen, with heart, conscience and motive un-\\n\\n219\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\ndefiled\\n; unconquered and unconquerable, stand\\n\\ning always and ever foursquare to the world,\\n\\nstruggling sublimely on to highest ideals. If this\\n\\nwas Dalleszona s past, what must her future be?\\n\\nWas he worthy of the love, devotion and in\\n\\nspiration of this bloom and blessing of fifteen\\n\\nhundred years? Could he make her happy? And\\n\\nhow about the blanks in his own life through the\\n\\nprocess of years?\\n\\nWhen Torclez turned to Saxon for instruc\\n\\ntion, he did not speak, but his eyes questioned\\n\\nDalleszona. Placing her restless but firm little\\n\\nhand in his, she said, &quot;Surely, Ben Igo, I would\\n\\nsee your people, especially your mother.&quot; When\\n\\nhis father and mother stepped into the corridor,\\n\\nvigorous and splendid, as he knew them before\\n\\nhe laid their mortal bodies to rest in the broad\\n\\nprairies of Kansas, fifteen years before, joy and\\n\\ngladness filled his soul, and he thanked God the\\n\\n220\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Chancellor\\n\\nblanks were so few, and the high resolves and\\n\\nhonest endeavors so many, and the upward long\\n\\nings, too, were great. Then &quot;backward, turn\\n\\nbackward, O time in your flight,&quot; across the\\nwaste of centuries in Old Asia. Blood and\\n\\nflame, joy and sorrow, laughter and tears, on,\\n\\nstill on, till a mighty throng surged around three\\n\\ncross trees upon a hill just outside the capital\\n\\ncity of the ancient Jebusites, while hills rocked\\n\\nand blinding darkness fell across the midday sun,\\n\\nand Saxon knew, once and forevermore that his\\n\\nancestors had witnessed the Crucifixion of the\\n\\nMan of Galilee.\\n\\nThe very air seemed dense and chill. Then\\n\\nTorclez spoke :\\n\\n&quot;Ben Igo, friend of my friend, Dalleszona,\\n\\nyou have not sought to know the future, but I\\n\\ncrave to reveal one day, just one day, in the\\n\\ntremendous future so near at hand.&quot;\\n\\n221\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nAgain the light in the corridor glowed, but\\n\\nnow twas planet earth, cleft in twain through\\n\\nthe heart of the Mother Sea, which appeared as\\n\\na mighty scroll with millions and millions and\\n\\nstill more millions of human beings struggling in\\n\\na sea of blood that swelled to tumultuous flood,\\n\\nbut swiftly ebbed away while the mighty spirit\\n\\nof brotherhood illumined the velvet sky, and\\n\\nabove the faces of wives and mothers and daugh\\n\\nters and sweethearts the beautiful hand of\\n\\nwomanhood wrote these words &quot;Faith Hope\\n\\nLove,&quot; and the voice of kindred tribes, tongues,\\n\\nnations and races swelled in thunderous diapason,\\n\\n&quot;Peace on earth, Good will to men.&quot; &quot;We\\n\\nmust have a Business Manager to lead the na\\n\\ntions who will deal with honesty and truth, a\\n\\nChancellor of World Life to lead us to the\\n\\nLand of the Heart s Desire.&quot;\\n\\nPassing from the grotto, their hearts throb-\\n\\n222\\n\\n\\n\\nbing with tumultuous mystery and unanswerable\\n\\nquestionings, hand in hand they climbed to the\\n\\ntopmost seats of the splendid amphitheater, to\\n\\nwatch the miracles of cloudlands wheel across the\\n\\nsunbeamed spaces. Silently, swiftly, snow-white\\n\\ncloud continents, piled heaven high, swung into\\n\\nplace south and east, as the low-descending sun s\\n\\nfiery lances shot them through with phantom\\n\\nglory.\\n\\nWhen these billows of snow and flame rolled\\n\\nin unbroken tides from the Mayan Gulf to the\\n\\njagged summits of the Cordilleras, and the\\n\\nheavens above seemed transfused writh rose and\\n\\ngold, Saxon turned to Dalleszona, simply, but\\n\\nearnestly :\\n\\n&quot;Dalleszona, you must know I have loved and\\n\\ndo now love you with all my heart and soul.\\n\\nDo you love me? Will you be my wife?&quot;\\n\\nHis heart was satisfied with the light in her\\n\\n223\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\neyes as she took his face between her hands,\\n\\ndrawing it close to her own, and said, in low,\\n\\nsweet voice, &quot;Ben Igo, my Ben Igo, for five years\\nI have loved you with an everlasting love.\\n\\nWhere you go I will go. Where you live I will\\n\\nlive. Your people shall be my people, your God\\n\\nmy God. Into your care and keeping I gladly\\n\\ngive all I am or may be in this world or the\\n\\nnext. I will be your wife.&quot;\\n\\nLengthening shadows warned of approaching\\n\\nnight. The voiceless magic of the twilight hour\\n\\nbreathed its enchantment over an entirely new\\n\\nworld for these two happy hearts. With the\\n\\nwonder of loving upon them and the mystery of\\n\\nheaven about them, the bloom of life and fra\\n\\ngrance of spirit surged through heart and brain\\n\\nwith passionate power. Lover and sweetheart\\n\\nsaw visions and dreamed dreams and whispered\\n\\nairy nothings of eternal charm. The Aztec moon\\n\\n224\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Chancellor\\n\\nrose full and free above the Mayan Gulf, with\\n\\nthe face of the Toltec Queen smiling, and in\\n\\nvoluntarily Saxon thought of Highfmger, his\\n\\nstrange erratic friend, from whose leadings this\\n\\ngreat blessing and perfect happiness had come to\\n\\nhim.\\n\\n&quot;Dalleszona, my Dalleszona, you have loved\\n\\nme all these years. When did you first suspect\\nI loved you?&quot;\\n\\n&quot;I never did suspect it. I knew, that night\\n\\nwe camped in the Valley of the Oleanders, when\\n\\nwe climbed above the laughing waters, and you\\n\\nasked me to tell you somewhat of my people and\\n\\nthe manner of their coming. I also knew you\\n\\nwere battling with race prejudice, and that was\\n\\nwhy the mirage the next morning meant so much\\n\\nfor me.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;And yet you never let me know by word or\\n\\n225\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nsign, through all the years, you naughty, naughty,\\n\\nprecious girl.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Well, you see, it is this way. We Toltecs\\nhave a legend from ancient days that, when the\\n\\nworld was young, Faith, Hope and Love lived in\\n\\na temple all their own. To this temple mortals\\n\\ncame with their selfishness, greed, suspicion, envy,\\n\\njealousy, hate and revenge in their hearts; but,\\n\\nremaining there for a time, these evil passions\\n\\nbegan to atrophy, sicken and die one by one,\\n\\nnot one could live beyond five years. No sane\\n\\nwoman would ever marry a man if she knew he\\n\\nhad these misery breeding germs in his spirit.\\n\\nBut the trouble is that men are so nice during\\n\\ncourtship days, the women think they are per\\n\\nfectly lovely, sweet angels. Short courtships and\\n\\nlong divorces seem to be close friends now-a-days.\\n\\nBut, if you can get a man to behave himself for\\n\\nfive years, he is a pretty safe investment as a\\n\\n226\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Chancellor\\n\\nhusband. We Toltecs do not propose to make a\\nfailure of the greatest thing in life, nor enter the\\n\\nnext with tremendous handicap of a vagabond\\n\\nhusband. So for fifteen hundred years every\\n\\ndaughter of the House of Iximaga has been\\n\\ncourted at least five years before her wedding\\n\\nday, and happiness has always come to them,\\n\\neven through all the centuries when our power\\n\\nand greatness was brought to desolation. During\\n\\ncourtship both lover and sweetheart live their\\n\\nbest, look their best, do their best to please the\\n\\nother. This habit of doing one s best goes with\\n\\nthem into married life and brings great joy. So,\\n\\nyou see, Ben Igo, no matter about that chan\\n\\ncellorship, or any other thing in all the world,\\n\\nyou and I are going to have everlasting happiness\\n\\nfor all the coming years, and that is greatest\\n\\nwealth and highest power.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;But tell me, sweetheart, what do you think\\n\\n227\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nof this vision of Torclez concerning the chan\\n\\ncellorship. Perhaps Cantone will be elected. You\\n\\nknow he looked very happy as he passed down\\n\\nthe corridor.&quot;\\n\\n&quot;Never you worry, my great and mighty\\nchancellor. Cantone won t come in a million\\n\\nmiles, nor votes either, of the chancellorship.\\n\\nThe House of Iximaga has been preserved for\\n\\nsuch an hour as this. I believe Torclez s vision\\n\\nabsolutely. I spoke for you at the rally, and you\\n\\nsurely will be chosen chancellor to-morrow, and\\n\\nChalcedon will soon rule the world in peace and\\n\\nlove. It must be so because this cruel war has\\n\\ndestroyed the wealth it took a hundred years to\\n\\nproduce. We have the gold and silver stored in\\nGod s own treasure vaults, to finance a bankrupt\\nworld. Our petroleum reservoirs can furnish\\n\\nfuel for airships, submarines and merchant fleets\\n\\nof a globe. Within thirty days the ambassadors\\n\\n228\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Chancellor\\n\\nof Europe and Asia will be knocking at our doors,\\n\\nimploring our aid. Chalcedon can and shall lead\\n\\nthe nations on to undreamed heights of material\\n\\nsplendor and spiritual power.\\n\\n&quot;Come, Ben Igo, the happy hearts of Truxlan\\n\\nwill soon swell the vesper song. Already the\\n\\npilots of our merchant squadrons are dropping\\n\\nthrough the purple twilight to hangars on the\\n\\nmesa. Let us swing the Mystery Maid into\\n\\nthe mystic moonlight and drop through the\\n\\nboundless spaces to Home Sweet Home.&quot;\\n\\nSo ended the perfect day.\\n\\nDalleszona s prophecy was correct. Only an\\n\\ninspired womanhood can vision the reconstruction\\n\\nof the nations and sense the divine forces that\\n\\nshall regenerate the governments of a world.\\n\\nThe Womanhood Age is at hand, and the world s\\n\\nbest blessings must soon be realized.\\n\\nTwenty days later five thousand airships were\\n\\n229\\n\\n\\n\\nDalleszona\\n\\nstraining at their moorings in Truxlan, of latest\\n\\ndesign, aluminum-double-hulled, vacuum cham\\n\\nbered, passenger-carrying transports, capable of\\n\\nhighest speed and practically immune from ac\\n\\ncident from falling.\\n\\nThe wedding day of Saxon and Dalleszona,\\n\\nand the inauguration of Saxon as permanent\\n\\nchancellor, was the occasion of this gathering\\n\\nnow. The rites were to be administered at the\\n\\nForum, and the fleet was to carry the thousands\\n\\nthere. But how may I describe the manner of\\n\\ntheir going. No such sight had ever been wit\\n\\nnessed on this earth.

       " 'ONE \\n WHEN SUTTY WENT  back to Earth in the daytime, it was always to the village. At night, it was the Pale. \\n Yellow of brass, yellow of turmeric paste and of rice cooked with saffron, orange of marigolds, dull orange haze of sunset dust above the fields, henna red, passionflower red, dried-blood red, mud red: all the colors of sunlight in the day. A whiff of asafetida. The brook-babble of Aunty gossiping with Moti’s mother on the verandah. Uncle Hurree’s dark hand lying still on a white page. Ganesh’s little piggy kindly eye. A match struck and the rich grey curl of incense smoke: pungent, vivid, gone. Scents, glimpses, echoes that drifted or glimmered through her mind when she was walking the streets, or eating, or taking a break from the sensory assault of the neareals she had to partiss in, in the daytime, under the other sun. \\n But night is the same on any world. Light’s absence is only that. And in the darkness, it was the Pale she was in. Not in dream, never in dream. Awake, before she slept, or when she woke from dream, disturbed and tense, and could not get back to sleep. A scene would begin to happen, not in sweet, bright bits but in full recall of a place and a length of time; and once the memory began, she could not stop it. She had to go through it until it let her go. Maybe it was a kind of punishment, like the lovers’ punishment in Dante’s Hell, to remember being happy. But those lovers were lucky, they remembered it together. \\n The rain. The first winter in Vancouver rain. The sky like a roof of lead weighing down on the tops of buildings, flattening the huge black mountains up behind the city. Southward the rain-rough grey water of the Sound, under which lay Old Vancouver, drowned by the sea rise long ago. Black sleet on shining asphalt streets. Wind, the wind that made her whimper like a dog and cringe, shivering with a scared exhilaration, it was so fierce and crazy, that cold wind out of the Arctic, ice breath of the snow bear. It went right through her flimsy coat, but her boots were warm, huge ugly black plastic boots splashing in the gutters, and she’d soon be home. It made you feel safe, that awful cold. People hurried past not bothering each other, all their hates and passions frozen. She liked the North, the cold, the rain, the beautiful, dismal city. \\n Aunty looked so little, here, little and ephemeral, like a small butterfly. A red-and-orange cotton saree, thin brass bangles on insect wrists. Though there were plenty of Indians and Indo-Canadians here, plenty of neighbors, Aunty looked small even among them, displaced, misplaced. Her smile seemed foreign and apologetic. She had to wear shoes and stockings all the time. Only when she got ready for bed did her feet reappear, the small brown feet of great character which had always, in the village, been a visible part of her as much as her hands, her eyes. Here her feet were put away in leather cases, amputated by the cold. So she didn’t walk much, didn’t run about the house, bustle about the kitchen. She sat by the heater in the front room, wrapped up in a pale ragged knitted woollen blanket, a butterfly going back into its cocoon. Going away, farther away all the time, but not by walking. \\n Sutty found it easier now to know Mother and Father, whom she had scarcely known for the last fifteen years, than to know Aunty, whose lap and arms had been her haven. It was delightful to discover her parents, her mother’s good-natured wit and intellect, her father’s shy, unhandy efforts at showing affection. To converse with them as an adult while knowing herself unreasonably beloved as a child—it was easy, it was delightful. They talked about everything, they learned one another. While Aunty shrank, fluttered away very softly, deviously, seeming not to be going anywhere, back to the village, to Uncle Hurree’s grave. \\n Spring came, fear came. Sunlight came back north here long and pale like an adolescent, a silvery shadowy radiance. Small pink plum trees blossomed all down the side streets of the neighborhood. The Fathers declared that the Treaty of Beijing contravened the Doctrine of Unique Destiny and must be abrogated. The Pales were to be opened, said the Fathers, their populations allowed to receive the Holy Light, their schools cleansed of unbelief, purified of alien error and deviance. Those who clung to sin would be re-educated. \\n Mother was down at the Link offices every day, coming home late and grim. This is their final push, she said; if they do this, we have nowhere to go but underground. \\n In late March, a squadron of planes from the Host of God flew from Colorado to the District of Washington and bombed the Library there, plane after plane, four hours of bombing that turned centuries of history and millions of books into dirt. Washington was not a Pale, but the beautiful old building, though often closed and kept locked, under guard, had never been attacked; it had endured through all the times of trouble and war, breakdown and revolution, until this one. The Time of Cleansing. The Commander-General of the Hosts of the Lord announced the bombing while it was in progress, as an educational action. Only one Word, only one Book. All other words, all other books were darkness, error. They were dirt.  Let the Lord shine out!  cried the pilots in their white uniforms and mirror-masks, back at the church at Colorado Base, facelessly facing the cameras and the singing, swaying crowds in ecstasy.  Wipe away the filth and let the Lord shine out! \\n But the new Envoy who had arrived from Hain last year, Dalzul, was talking with the Fathers. They had admitted Dalzul to the Sanctum. There were neareals and holos and 2Ds of him in the net and  Godsword . It seemed that the Commander-General of the Hosts had not received orders from the Fathers to destroy the Library of Washington. The error was not the Commander-General’s, of course. Fathers made no errors. The pilots’ zeal had been excessive, their action unauthorised. Word came from the Sanctum: the pilots were to be punished. They were led out in front of the ranks and the crowds and the cameras, publicly stripped of their weapons and white uniforms. Their hoods were taken off, their faces were bared. They were led away in shame to re-education. \\n All that was on the net, though Sutty could watch it without having to partiss in it, Father having disconnected the vr-proprios.  Godsword  was full of it, too. And full of the new Envoy, again. Dalzul was a Terran. Born right here on God’s Earth, they said. A man who understood the men of Earth as no alien ever could, they said. A man from the stars who came to kneel at the feet of the Fathers and to discuss the implementation of the peaceful intentions of both the Holy Office and the Ekumen. \\n “Handsome fellow,” Mother said, peering. “What is he? A white man?” \\n “Inordinately so,” Father said. \\n “Wherever is he from?” \\n But no one knew. Iceland, Ireland, Siberia, everybody had a different story. Dalzul had left Terra to study on Hain, they all agreed on that. He had qualified very quickly as an Observer, then as a Mobile, and then had been sent back home: the first Terran Envoy to Terra. \\n “He left well over a century ago,” Mother said. “Before the Unists took over East Asia and Europe. Before they even amounted to much in Western Asia. He must find his world quite changed.” \\n Lucky man, Sutty was thinking. Oh lucky, lucky man! He got away, he went to Hain, he studied at the School on Ve, he’s been where everything isn’t God and hatred, where they’ve lived a million years of history, where they understand it all! \\n That same night she told Mother and Father that she wanted to study at the Training School, to try to qualify for the Ekumenical College. Told them very timidly, and found them undismayed, not even surprised. “This seems a rather good world to get off of, at present,” Mother said. \\n They were so calm and favorable that she thought, Don’t they realise, if I qualify and get sent to one of the other worlds, they’ll never see me again? Fifty years, a hundred, hundreds, round trips in space were seldom less, often more. Didn’t they care? It was only later that evening, when she was watching her father’s profile at table, full lips, hook nose, hair beginning to go grey, a severe and fragile face, that it occurred to her that if she was sent to another world, she would never see them again either. They had thought about it before she did. Brief presence and long absence, that was all she and they had ever had. And made the best of it. \\n “Eat, Aunty,” Mother said, but Aunty only patted her piece of naan with her little ant-antenna fingers and did not pick it up. \\n “Nobody could make good bread with such flour,” she said, exonerating the baker. \\n “You were spoiled, living in the village,” Mother teased her. “This is the best quality anybody can get in Canada. Best quality chopped straw and plaster dust.” \\n “Yes, I was spoiled,” Aunty said, smiling from a far country. \\n \\n The older slogans were carved into facades of buildings:  FORWARD TO THE FUTURE. PRODUCER-CONSUMERS OF AKA MARCH TO THE STARS . Newer ones ran across the buildings in bands of dazzling electronic display:  REACTIONARY THOUGHT IS THE DEFEATED ENEMY . When the displays malfunctioned, the messages became cryptic:  OD IS ON.  The newest ones hovered in holopro above the streets:  PURE SCIENCE DESTROYS CORRUPTION. UPWARD ONWARD FORWARD.  Music hovered with them, highly rhythmic, multivoiced, crowding the air. “Onward, onward to the stars!” an invisible choir shrilled to the stalled traffic at the intersection where Sutty’s robocab sat. She turned up the cab sound to drown the tune out. “Superstition is a rotting corpse,” the sound system said in a rich, attractive male voice. “Superstitious practices defile youthful minds. It is the responsibility of every citizen, whether adult or student, to report reactionary teachings and to bring teachers who permit sedition or introduce irrationality and superstition in their classroom to the attention of the authorities. In the light of Pure Science we know that the ardent cooperation of all the people is the first requisite of—” Sutty turned the sound down as far as it would go. The choir burst forth, “To the stars! To the stars!” and the robocab jerked forward about half its length. Two more jerks and it might get through the intersection at the next flowchange. \\n Sutty felt in her jacket pockets for an akagest, but she’d eaten them all. Her stomach hurt. Bad food, she’d eaten too much bad food for too long, processed stuff jacked up with proteins, condiments, stimulants, so you had to buy the stupid akagests. And the stupid unnecessary traffic jams because the stupid badly made cars broke down all the time, and the noise all the time, the slogans, the songs, the hype, a people hyping itself into making every mistake every other population in FF-tech mode had ever made.—Wrong. \\n Judgmentalism. Wrong to let frustration cloud her thinking and perceptions. Wrong to admit prejudice. Look, listen, notice: observe. That was her job. This wasn’t her world. \\n But she was on it, in it, how could she observe it when there was no way to back off from it? Either the hyperstimulation of the neareals she had to study, or the clamor of the streets: nowhere to get away from the endless aggression of propaganda, except alone in her apartment, shutting out the world she’d come to observe. \\n The fact was, she was not suited to be an Observer here. In other words, she had failed on her first assignment. She knew that the Envoy had summoned her to tell her so. \\n She was already nearly late for the appointment. The robocab made another jerk forward, and its sound system came up loud for one of the Corporation announcements that overrode low settings. There was no off button. “An announcement from the Bureau of Astronautics!” said a woman’s vibrant, energy-charged, self-confident voice, and Sutty put her hands over her ears and shouted, “Shut up!” \\n “Doors of vehicle are closed,” the robocab said in the flat mechanical voice assigned to mechanisms responding to verbal orders. Sutty saw that this was funny, but she couldn’t laugh. The announcement went on and on while the shrill voices in the air sang, “Ever higher, ever greater, marching to the stars!” \\n The Ekumenical Envoy, a doe-eyed Chiffewarian named Tong Ov, was even later than she for their appointment, having been delayed at the exit of his apartment house by a malfunction of the ZIL-screening system, which he laughed about. “And the system here has mislaid the microrec I wanted to give you,” he said, going through files in his office. “I coded it, because of course they go through my files, and my code confused the system. But I know it’s in here…So, meanwhile, tell me how things have been going.” \\n “Well,” Sutty said, and paused. She had been speaking and thinking in Dovzan for months. She had to go through her own files for a moment: Hindi no, English no, Hainish yes. “You asked me to prepare a report on contemporary language and literature. But the social changes that took place here while I was in transit…Well, since it’s against the law, now, to speak or study any language but Dovzan and Hainish, I can’t work on the other languages. If they still exist. As for Dovzan, the First Observers did a pretty thorough linguistic survey. I can only add details and vocabulary.” \\n “What about literature?” Tong asked. \\n “Everything that was written in the old scripts has been destroyed. Or if it exists, I don’t know what it is, because the Ministry doesn’t allow access to it. So all I was able to work on is modern aural literature. All written to Corporation specifications. It tends to be very—to be standardised.” \\n She looked at Tong Ov to see if her whining bored him, but though still looking for the mislaid file, he seemed to be listening with lively interest. He said, “All aural, is it?” \\n “Except for the Corporation manuals hardly anything’s printed, except printouts for the deaf, and primers to accompany sound texts for early learners…The campaign against the old ideographic forms seems to have been very intense. Maybe it made people afraid to write—made them distrust writing in general. Anyway, all I’ve been able to get hold of by way of literature is sound tapes and neareals. Issued by the World Ministry of Information and the Central Ministry of Poetry and Art. Most of the works are actually information or educational material rather than, well, literature or poetry as I understand the terms. Though a lot of the neareals are dramatisations of practical or ethical problems and solutions—” She was trying so hard to speak factually, unjudgmentally, without prejudice, that her voice was totally toneless. \\n “Sounds dull,” said Tong, still flitting through files. \\n “Well, I’m, I think I’m insensitive to this aesthetic. It is so deeply and, and, and flatly political. Of course every art is political. But when it’s  all  didactic, all in the service of a belief system, I resent, I mean, I resist it. But I try not to. Maybe, since they’ve essentially erased their history—Of course there was no way of knowing they were on the brink of a cultural revolution, at the time I was sent here—But anyhow, for this particular Observer-ship, maybe a Terran was a bad choice. Given that we on Terra are living the future of a people who denied their past.” \\n She stopped short, appalled at everything she had said. \\n Tong looked round at her, unappalled. He said, “I don’t wonder that you feel that what you’ve been trying to do can’t be done. But I needed your opinion. So it was worth it to me. But tiresome for you. A change is in order.” There was a gleam in his dark eyes. “What do you say to going up the river?” \\n “The river?” \\n “It’s how they say ‘into the backwoods,’ isn’t it? But in fact I meant the Ereha.” \\n When he said the name, she remembered that a big river ran through the capital, partly paved over and so hidden by buildings and embankments that she couldn’t remember ever having seen it except on maps. \\n “You mean go outside Dovza City?” \\n “Yes,” Tong said. “Outside the city! And not on a guided tour! For the first time in fifty years!” He beamed like a child revealing a hidden present, a beautiful surprise. “I’ve been here two years, and I’ve put in eighty-one requests for permission to send a staff member to live or stay somewhere outside Dovza City or Kangnegne or Ert. Politely evaded, eighty times, with offers of yet another guided tour of the space-program facilities or the beauty of spring in the Eastern Isles. I put in such requests by habit, by rote. And suddenly one is granted! Yes! ‘A member of your staff is authorised to spend a month in Okzat-Ozkat.’ Or is it Ozkat-Okzat? Its a small city, in the foothills, up the river. The Ereha rises in the High Headwaters Range, about fifteen hundred kilos inland. I asked for that area, Rangma, never expecting to get it, and I got it!” He beamed. \\n “Why there?” \\n “I heard about some people there who sound interesting.” \\n “An ethnic fragment population?” she asked, hopeful. Early in her stay, when she first met Tong Ov and the other two Observers presently in Dovza City, they had all discussed the massive monoculturalism of modern Aka in its large cities, the only places the very few offworlders permitted on the planet were allowed to live. They were all convinced that Akan society must have diversities and regional variations and frustrated that they had no way to find out. \\n “Sectarians, I suspect, rather than ethnic. A cult. Possibly remnants in hiding of a banned religion.” \\n “Ah,” she said, trying to preserve her expression of interest. \\n Tong was still searching his files. “I’m looking for the little I’ve gathered on the subject. Sociocultural Bureau reports on surviving criminal antiscientific cult activities. And also a few rumors and tales. Secret rites, walking on the wind, miraculous cures, predictions of the future. The usual.” \\n To fall heir to a history of three million years was to find little in human behavior or invention that could be called unusual. Though the Hainish bore it lightly, it was a burden on their various descendants to know that they would have a hard time finding a new thing, even an imaginary new thing, under any sun. \\n Sutty said nothing. \\n “In the material the First Observers here sent to Terra,” Tong pursued, “did anything concerning religions get through?” \\n “Well, since nothing but the language report came through undamaged, information about anything was pretty much only what we could infer from vocabulary.” \\n “All that information from the only people ever allowed to study Aka freely—lost in a glitch,” said Tong, sitting back and letting a search complete itself in his files. “What terrible luck! Or was it a glitch?” \\n Like all Chiffewarians, Tong was quite hairless—a chihuahua, in the slang of Valparaiso. To minimize his outlandishness here, where baldness was very uncommon, he wore a hat; but since the Akans seldom wore hats, he looked perhaps more alien with it than without it. He was a gentle-mannered man, informal, straightforward, putting Sutty as much at her ease as she was capable of being; yet he was so uninvasive as to be, finally, aloof. Himself uninvadable, he offered no intimacy. She was grateful that he accepted her distance. Up to now, he had kept his. But she felt his question as disingenuous. He knew, surely, that the loss of the transmission had been no accident. Why should she have to explain it? She had made it clear that she was traveling without luggage, just as Observers and Mobiles who’d been in space for centuries did. She was not answerable for the place she had left sixty light-years behind her. She was not responsible for Terra and its holy terrorism. \\n But the silence went on, and she said at last, “The Beijing ansible was sabotaged.” \\n “Sabotaged?” \\n She nodded. \\n “By the Unists?” \\n “Toward the end of the regime there were attacks on most of the Ekumenical installations and the treaty areas. The Pales.” \\n “Were many of them destroyed?” \\n He was trying to draw her out. To get her to talk about it. Anger flooded into her, rage. Her throat felt tight. She said nothing, because she was unable to say anything. \\n A considerable pause. \\n “Nothing but the language got through, then,” Tong said. \\n “Almost nothing.” \\n “Terrible luck!” he repeated energetically. “That the First Observers were Terran, so they sent their report to Terra instead of Hain—not unnaturally, but still, bad luck. And even worse, maybe, that ansible transmissions sent  from  Terra all got through. All the technical information the Akans asked for and Terra sent, without any question or restriction…Why, why would the First Observers have agreed to such a massive cultural intervention?” \\n “Maybe they didn’t. Maybe the Unists sent it.” \\n “Why would the Unists start Aka marching to the stars?” \\n She shrugged. “Proselytising.” \\n “You mean, persuading others to believe what they believed? Was industrial technological progress incorporated as an element of the Unist religion?” \\n She kept herself from shrugging. \\n “So during that period when the Unists refused ansible contact with the Stabiles on Hain, they were… converting  the Akans? Sutty, do you think they may have sent, what do you call them, missionaries, here?” \\n “I don’t know.” \\n He was not probing her, not trapping her. Eagerly pursuing his own thoughts, he was only trying to get her, a Terran, to explain to him what the Terrans had done and why. But she would not and could not explain or speak for the Unists. \\n Picking up her refusal to speculate, he said, “Yes, yes, I’m sorry. Of course you were scarcely in the confidence of the Unist leaders! But I’ve just had an idea, you see—If they did send missionaries, and if they transgressed Akan codes in some way, you see?—that might explain the Limit Law.” He meant the abrupt announcement, made fifty years ago and enforced ever since, that only four offworlders would be allowed on Aka at a time, and only in the cities. “And it could explain the banning of religion a few years later!” He was carried away by his theory. He beamed, and then asked her almost pleadingly, “You never heard of a second group sent here from Terra?” \\n “No.” \\n He sighed, sat back. After a minute he dismissed his speculations with a little flip of his hand. “We’ve been here seventy years,” he said, “and all we know is the vocabulary.” \\n She relaxed. They were off Terra, back on Aka. She was safe. She spoke carefully, but with the fluency of relief. “In my last year in training, some facsimile artifacts were reconstituted from the damaged records. Pictures, a few fragments of books. But not enough to extrapolate any major cultural elements from. And since the Corporation State was in place when I arrived, I don’t know anything about what it replaced. I don’t even know when religion was outlawed here. About forty years ago?” She heard her voice: placating, false, forced. Wrong. \\n Tong nodded. “Thirty years after the first contact with the Ekumen. The Corporation put out the first decree declaring ‘religious practice and teaching’ unlawful. Within a few years they were announcing appalling penalties…But what’s odd about it, what made me think the impetus might have come from offworld, is the word they use for religion.” \\n “Derived from Hainish,” Sutty said, nodding. \\n “Was there no native word? Do you know one?” \\n “No,” she said, after conscientiously going through not only her Dovzan vocabulary but several other Akan languages she had studied at Valparaíso. “I don’t.” \\n A great deal of the recent vocabulary of Dovzan of course came from offworld, along with the industrial technologies; but that they should borrow a word for a native institution in order to outlaw it? Odd indeed. And she should have noticed it. She would have noticed it, if she had not tuned out the word, the thing, the subject, whenever it came up. Wrong. Wrong. \\n Tong had become a bit distracted; the item he had been searching for had turned up at last, and he set his noter to retrieve and decode. This took some time. “Akan microfiling leaves something to be desired,” he said, poking a final key. \\n “‘Everything breaks down on schedule,’” Sutty said. “That’s the only Akan joke I know. The trouble with it is, it’s true.” \\n “But consider what they’ve accomplished in seventy years!” The Envoy sat back, warmly discursive, his hat slightly askew. “Rightly or wrongly, they were given the blueprint for a G86.” G86 was Hainish historians’ shorthand jargon for a society in fast-forward industrial technological mode. “And they devoured that information in one gulp. Remade their culture, established the Corporate worldstate, got a spaceship off to Hain—all in a single human lifetime! Amazing people, really. Amazing unity of discipline!” \\n Sutty nodded dutifully. \\n “But there must have been resistance along the way. This antireligious obsession…Even if we triggered it along with the technological expansion…” \\n It was decent of him, Sutty thought, to keep saying “we,” as if the Ekumen had been responsible for Terra’s intervention in Aka. That was the underlying Hainish element in Ekumenical thinking:  Take responsibility. \\n The Envoy was pursuing his thought. “The mechanisms of control are so pervasive and effective, they must have been set up in response to something powerful, don’t you think? If resistance to the Corporate State centered in a religion—a well-established, widespread religion—that would explain the Corporation’s suppression of religious practices. And the attempt to set up national theism as a replacement. God as Reason, the Hammer of Pure Science, all that. In the name of which to destroy the temples, ban the preachings. What do you think?” \\n “I think it understandable,” Sutty said. \\n It was perhaps not the response he had expected. They were silent for a minute. \\n “The old writing, the ideograms,” Tong said, “you can read them fluently?” \\n “It was all there was to learn when I was in training. It was the only writing on Aka, seventy years ago.” \\n “Of course,” he said, with the disarming Chiffewarian gesture that signified  Please forgive the idiot.  “Coming from only twelve years’ distance, you see, I learned only the modern script.” \\n “Sometimes I’ve wondered if I’m the only person on Aka who can read the ideograms. A foreigner, an offworlder. Surely not.” \\n “Surely not. Although the Dovzans are a systematic people. So systematic that when they banned the old script, they also systematically destroyed whatever was written in it—poems, plays, history, philosophy. Everything, you think?” \\n She remembered the increasing bewilderment of her early weeks in Dovza City: her incredulity at the scant and vapid contents of what they called libraries, the blank wall that met all her attempts at research, when she had still believed there had to be some remnants, somewhere, of the literature of an entire world. \\n “If they find any books or texts, even now, they destroy them,” she said. “One of the principal bureaus of the Ministry of Poetry is the Office of Book Location. They find books, confiscate them, and send them to be pulped for building material. Insulating material. The old books are referred to as pulpables. A woman there told me that she was going to be sent to another bureau because there were no more pulpables in Dovza. It was clean, she said. Cleansed.” \\n She heard her voice getting edgy. She looked away, tried to ease the tension in her shoulders. \\n Tong Ov remained calm. “An entire history lost, wiped out, as if by a terrible disaster,” he said. “Extraordinary!” \\n “Not that unusual,” she said, very edgily—Wrong. She rearranged her shoulders again, breathed in once and out once, and spoke with conscious quietness. “The few Akan poems and drawings that were reconstructed at the Terran Ansible Center would be illegal here. I had copies with me in my noter. I erased them,” \\n “Yes. Yes, quite right. We can’t introduce anything that they don’t want to have lying about.” \\n “1 hated to do it. I felt I was colluding.” \\n “The margin between collusion and respect can be narrow,” Tong said. “Unfortunately, we exist in that margin, here.” \\n For a moment she felt a dark gravity in him. He was looking away, looking far away. Then he was back with her, genial and serene. \\n “But then,” he said, “there are a good many scraps of the old calligraphy painted up here and there around the city, aren’t there? No doubt it’s considered harmless since no one now can read it…And things tend to survive in out-of-the-way places. I was down in the river district one evening—it’s quite disreputable, I shouldn’t have been there, but now and then one can wander about in a city this size without one’s hosts knowing it. At least I pretend they don’t. At any rate, I heard some unusual music. Wooden instruments. Illegal intervals.” \\n She looked her question. \\n “Composers are required by the Corporation State to use what I know as the Terran octave.” \\n Sutty looked stupid. \\n Tong sang an octave. \\n Sutty tried to look intelligent. \\n “They call it the Scientific Scale of Intervals, here,” Tong said. And still seeing no great sign of understanding, he asked, smiling, “Does Akan music sound rather more familiar to you than you had expected?” \\n “I hadn’t thought about it—I don’t know. I can’t carry a tune. I don’t know what keys are.” \\n Tong’s smile grew broad. “To my ear Akan music sounds as if none of them knew what a key is. Well, what I heard down in the river district wasn’t like the music on the loudspeakers at all. Different intervals. Very subtle harmonies. ‘Drug music,’ the people there called it. I gathered that drug music is played by faith healers, witch doctors. So one way and another I managed eventually to arrange a chat with one of these doctors. He said, ‘We know some of the old songs and medicines. We don’t know the stories. We can’t tell them. The people who told the stories are gone.’ I pressed him a little, and he said, ‘Maybe some of them are still up the river there. In the mountains.’” Tong Ov smiled again, but wistfully. “I longed for more, but of course my presence there put him at risk.” He made rather a long pause. “One has this sense, sometimes, that…” \\n “That it’s all our fault.” \\n After a moment he said, “Yes. It is. But since we’re here, we have to try to keep our presence light.” \\n Chiffewarians took responsibility, but did not cultivate guilt the way Terrans did. She knew she had misinterpreted him. She knew he was surprised by what she had said. But she could not keep anything light. She said nothing. \\n “What do you think the witch doctor meant, about stories and the people who told them?” \\n She tried to get her mind around the question but couldn’t. She could not follow him any further. She knew what the saying meant: to come to the end of your tether. Her tether choked her, tight around her throat. \\n She said, “I thought you sent for me to tell me you were transferring me.” \\n “Off the planet? No! No, no,” Tong said, with surprise and a quiet kindness. \\n “I shouldn’t have been sent here.” \\n “Why do you say that?” \\n “I trained as a linguist and in literature. Aka has one language left and no literature. I wanted to be a historian. How can I, on a world that’s destroyed its history?” \\n “It’s not easy,” Tong said feelingly. He got up to check the file recorder. He said, “Please tell me, Sutty, is the institutionalised homophobia very difficult for you?” \\n “I grew up with it.” \\n “Under the Unists.” \\n “Not only the Unists.” \\n “I see,” Tong said. Still standing, he spoke carefully, looking at her; she looked down. “I know that you lived through a great religious upheaval. And I think of Terra as a world whose history has been shaped by religions. So I see you as the best fitted of us to investigate the vestiges, if they exist, of this world’s religion. Ki Ala has no experience of religion, you see, and Garru has no detachment from it.” He stopped again. She made no response. “Your experience,” he said, “may have been of a kind that would make detachment difficult for you. To have lived all your life under theocratic repression, and the turmoil and violence of the last years of Unism…” \\n She had to speak. She said coldly, “I believe my training will allow me to observe another culture without excessive prejudice.” \\n “Your training and your own temperament: yes. I believe so too. But the pressures of an aggressive theocracy, the great weight of it all through your life, may well have left you a residue of distrust, of resistance. If I’m asking you—again!—to observe something you detest, please tell me that.” \\n After a few seconds which seemed long to her she said, “I really am no good at all with music.” \\n “I think the music is a small element of something very large,” said Tong, doe-eyed, implacable. \\n “I see no problem, then,” she said. She felt cold, false, defeated. Her throat ached. \\n Tong waited a little for her to say more, and then accepted her word. He picked up the microcrystal record and gave it to her. She took it automatically. \\n “Read this and listen to the music here in the library, please, and then erase it,” he said. “Erasure is an art we must learn from the Akans. Seriously! I mean it. The Hainish want to hang on to everything. The Akans want to throw everything away. Maybe there’s a middle way? At any rate, we have our first chance to get into an area where maybe history wasn’t erased so thoroughly.” \\n “I don’t know if I’ll know what I’m seeing when I see it. Ki Ala’s been here ten years. You’ve had experience on four other worlds.” She had told him there was no problem. She had said she could do what he asked. Now she heard herself still trying to whine her way out of it. Wrong. Shameful. \\n “I’ve never lived through a great social revolution,” Tong said. “Nor has Ki Ala. We’re children of peace, Sutty. I need a child of conflict. Anyhow, Ki Ala is illiterate. I am illiterate. You can read.” \\n “Dead languages in a banned script.” \\n Tong looked at her again for a minute in silence, with an intellectual, impersonal, real tenderness. “I believe you tend to undervalue your capacities, Sutty,” he said. “The Stabiles chose you to be one of the four representatives of the Ekumen on Aka. I need you to accept the fact that your experience and your knowledge are essential to me, to our work here. Please consider that.” \\n He waited until she said, “I will.” \\n “Before you go up to the mountains, if you do, I also want you to consider the risks. Or rather to consider the fact that we don’t know what the risks may be. The Akans seem not to be a violent people; but that’s hard to judge from our insulated position. I don’t know why they’ve suddenly given us this permission. Surely they have some reason or motive, but we can find what it is only by taking advantage of it.” He paused, his eyes still on her. “There’s no mention of your being accompanied, of having guides, watchdogs. You may be quite on your own. You may not. We don’t know. None of us knows what life is like outside the cities. Every difference or sameness, everything you see, everything you read, everything you record, will be important. I know already that you’re a sensitive and impartial observer. And if there’s any history left on Aka, you’re the member of my crew here best suited to find it. To go look for these ‘stories,’ or the people who know them. So, please, listen to these songs, and then go home and think about it, and tell me your decision tomorrow.  O.K.? ” \\n He said the old Terran phrase stiffly, with some pride in the accomplishment. Sutty tried to smile. “O.K.,” she said. \\n ',\n",
       " 'TWO \\n ON THE WAY  home, in the monorail, she suddenly broke into tears. Nobody noticed. Crowded in the car, people tired from work and dulled by the long rocking ride all sat watching the holopro above the aisle: children doing gymnastics, hundreds of tiny children in red uniforms kicking and jumping in unison to shrill cheery music in the air. \\n On the long climb up the stairs to her apartment she wept again. There was no reason to cry. There had to be a reason. She must be sick. The misery she felt was fear, a wretched panic of fear. Dread. Terror. It was crazy to send her off on her own. Tong was crazy to think of it. She could never handle it. She sat down at her workdesk to send him a formal request for return to Terra. The Hainish words would not come. They were all wrong. \\n Her head ached. She got up to find something to eat. There was nothing in her foodstorage, nothing at all. When had she eaten last? Not at midday. Not in the morning. Not last night. \\n “What’s wrong with me?” she said to the air. No wonder her stomach hurt. No wonder she had fits of weeping and panic. She had never in her life forgotten to eat. Even in that time, the time after, when she went back to Chile, even then she had cooked food and eaten it, forcing food salty with tears down her throat day after day after day. \\n “I won’t do this,” she said. She didn’t know what she meant. She refused to go on crying. \\n She walked back down the stairs, flashed her ZIL at the exit, walked ten blocks to the nearest Corp-Star foodshop, flashed her ZIL at the entrance. All the foods were packaged, processed, frozen, convenient; nothing fresh, nothing to cook. The sight of the wrapped rows made her tears break out again. Furious and humiliated, she bought a hot stuffed roll at the Eat Quick counter. The man serving was too busy to look at her face. \\n She stood outside the shop on the street, turned away from people passing by, and crammed the food into her mouth, salty with tears, forced herself to swallow, just like back then, back there. Back then she had known she had to live. It was her job. To live life after joy. Leave love and death behind her. Go on. Go alone and work. And now she was going to ask to get sent back to Earth? Back to death? \\n She chewed and swallowed. Music and slogans blared in broken bursts from passing vehicles. The light at a crossing four blocks away had failed, and robocab horns outblared the music. People on foot, the producer-consumers of the Corporation State, in uniforms of rust, tan, blue, green, or in Corporation-made standard trousers, tunics, jackets, all wearing canvas StarMarch shoes, came crowding past, coming up from the underground garages, hurrying toward one apartment house or another. \\n Sutty chewed and swallowed the last tough, sweet-salt lump of food. She would not go back. She would go on. Go alone and work. She went back to her apartment house, flashed her ZIL at the entrance, and climbed the eight flights of stairs. She had been given a big, flashy, top-floor apartment because it was considered suitable for an honored guest of the Corporation State. The elevator had not been working for a month. \\n \\n She nearly missed the boat. The robocab got lost trying to find the river. It took her to the Aquarium, then to the Bureau of Water Resources and Processing, then to the Aquarium again. She had to override it and reprogram it three times. As she scurried across the wharf, the crew of Ereha River Ferry Eight was just pulling in the gangway. She shouted, they shoved the gangway back down, she scrambled aboard. She tossed her bags into her tiny cabin and came out on deck to watch the city go by. \\n It showed a dingier, quieter side down here on the water, far under the canyon walls of the blocks and towers of business and government. Beneath huge concrete embankments were wooden docks and warehouses black with age, a water-beetle come-and-go of little boats on errands that were no doubt beneath the notice of the Ministry of Commerce, and houseboat communities wreathed in flowering vines, flapping laundry, and the stink of sewage. \\n A stream ran through a concrete ditch between high dark walls to join the great river. Above it a fisherman leaned on the rail of a humpback bridge: a silhouette, simple, immobile, timeless—the image of a drawing in one of the Akan books they had partially salvaged from the lost transmission. \\n How reverently she had handled those few pages of images, lines of poems, fragments of prose, how she had pored over them, back in Valparaiso, trying to feel from them what these people of another world were like, longing to know them. It had been hard to erase the copies from her noter, here, and no matter what Tong said, she still felt it as a wrong, a capitulation to the enemy. She had studied the copies in her noter one last time, lovingly, painfully, trying to hold on to them before she deleted them.  And there are no footprints in the dust behind us …She had shut her eyes as she deleted that poem. Doing so, she felt that she was erasing all her yearning hope that when she came to Aka she’d learn what it was about. \\n But she remembered the four lines of the poem, and the hope and yearning were still there. \\n The quiet engines of Ferry Eight drummed softly. Hour by hour the embankments grew lower, older, more often broken by stairs and landings. At last they sank away altogether into mud and reeds and shrubby banks, and the Ereha spread itself out wider and wider and amazingly wider across a flatness of green and yellow-green fields. \\n For five days the boat, moving steadily eastward on that steady breadth of water through mild sunshine and mild starry darkness, was the tallest thing in sight. Now and then it came to a riverside city where it would tie up at an old dock dwarfed under high new office and apartment towers and take on supplies and passengers. \\n Sutty found it amazingly easy to talk to people on the boat. In Dovza City everything had conspired to keep her reserved and silent. Though the four offworlders were given apartments and a certain freedom of movement, the Corporation scheduled their lives very closely with appointments, programming and supervising their work and amusements. Not that they were the only ones so controlled: Aka’s abrupt and tremendous technological advance was sustained by rigid discipline universally enforced and self-enforced. It seemed that everybody in the city worked hard, worked long hours, slept short hours, ate in haste. Every hour was scheduled. Everybody she’d been in touch with in the Ministries of Poetry and of Information knew exactly what they wanted her to do and how she should do it, and as soon as she started doing as they directed, they hurried off about their business, leaving her to hers. \\n Though the technologies and achievements of the Ekumenical worlds were held as the shining model for everything on Aka, the four visitors from the Ekumen were kept, as Tong said, in a fish tank. From time to time they were put on display to the public and in the neareals, smiling figures sitting at a Corporation banquet or somewhere near the chief of a bureau giving a speech; but they were not asked to speak. Only to smile. Possibly the ministers did not trust them to say exactly what they ought to say. Possibly the ministers found them rather flat, dull examples of the superior civilisations Aka was striving so hard to emulate. Most civilisations, perhaps, look shinier in general terms and from several light-years away. \\n Though Sutty had met many Akans and disliked few of them, after a half year on the planet she had scarcely had anything deserving the name of a conversation with any one of them. She had seen nothing of Akan private life except the stiff dinner parties of upper-level bureaucrats and Corporation officials. No personal friendship had ever come even remotely into view. No doubt the people she met had been advised not to talk with her more than necessary, so that the Corporation could remain in full control of the information she received. But even with people she saw constantly, intimacy did not grow. She did not feel this distance as prejudice, xenophobia; the Akans were remarkably unconcerned about foreignness as such. It was that they were all so busy, and all bureaucrats. Conversation went by program. At the banquets people talked business, sports, and technology. Waiting in lines or at the laundry, they talked sports and the latest neareals. They avoided the personal and, in public, repeated the Corporation line on all matters of policy and opinion, to the point of contradicting her when her description of her world didn’t tally with what they had been taught about wonderful, advanced, resourceful Terra. \\n But on the riverboat, people talked. They talked personally, intimately, and exhaustively. They leaned on the railing talking, sat around on the deck talking, stayed at the dinner table with a glass of wine talking. \\n A word or smile from her was enough to include her in their talk. And she realised, slowly, because it took her by surprise, that they didn’t know she was an alien. \\n They all knew there were Observers from the Ekumen on Aka; they’d seen them on the neareals, four infinitely remote, meaningless figures among the ministers and executives, stuffed aliens among the stuffed shirts; but they had no expectation of meeting one among ordinary people. \\n She had expected not only to be recognised but to be set apart and kept at a remove wherever she traveled. But no guides had been offered and no supervisors were apparent. It seemed that the Corporation had decided to let her be genuinely on her own. She had been on her own in the city, but in the fish tank, a bubble of isolation. The bubble had popped. She was outside. \\n It was a little frightening when she thought about it, but she didn’t think much about it, because it was such a pleasure. She was accepted—one of the travelers, one of the crowd. She didn’t have to explain, didn’t have to evade explanation, because they didn’t ask. She spoke Dovzan with no more accent, indeed less, than many Akans from regions other than Dovza. People assumed from her physical type—short, slight, dark-skinned—that she came from the east of the continent. “You’re from the east, aren’t you?” they said. “My cousin Muniti married a man from Turu,” and then they went on talking about themselves. \\n She heard about them, their cousins, their families, their jobs, their opinions, their houses, their hernias. People with pets traveled by riverboat, she discovered, petting a woman’s furry and affable kittypup. People who disliked or feared flying took the boat, as a chatty old gentleman told her in vast detail. People not in a hurry went by boat and told each other their stories. Sutty got told even more stories than most, because she listened without interrupting, except to say, Really? What happened then? and How wonderful! or How terrible! She listened with greed, tireless. These dull and fragmentary relations of ordinary lives could not bore her. Everything she had missed in Dovza City, everything the official literature, the heroic propaganda left out, they told. If she had to choose between heroes and hernias, it was no contest. \\n As they got farther upstream, deeper inland, passengers of a different kind began to come aboard. Country people used the riverboat as the simplest and cheapest way to get from one town to another—walk onto the boat here and get off it there. The towns were smaller now, without tall buildings. By the seventh day, passengers were boarding not with pets and luggage but with fowls in baskets, goats on leashes. \\n They weren’t exactly goats, or deer or cows or any other earthly thing; they were eberdin; but they blatted, and had silky hair, and in Sutty’s mental ecology they occupied the goat niche. They were raised for milk, meat, and the silky hair. In the old days, according to a bright-colored page of a picture book that had survived the lost transmission, eberdin had pulled carts and even carried riders. She remembered the blue-and-red banners on the cart, and the inscription under the picture:  SETTING OFF FOR THE GOLDEN MOUNTAIN . She wondered if it had been a fantasy for children, or a larger breed of eberdin. Nobody could ride these; they were only about knee-high. By the eighth day they were coming aboard in flocks. The aft deck was knee-deep in eberdin. \\n The city folk with pets and the aerophobes had all disembarked early that morning at Eltli, a big town that ran a railway line up into the South Headwaters Range resort country. Near Eltli the Ereha went through three locks, one very deep. Above them it was a different river—wilder, narrower, faster, its water not cloudy blue-brown but airy blue-green. \\n Long conversations also ended at Eltli. The country folk now on the boat were not unfriendly but were shy of strangers, talking mostly to their own acquaintances, in dialect. Sutty welcomed her recovered solitude, which left her eyes to see. \\n Off to the left as the stream bent north, mountain peaks spired up one after another, black rock, white glaciers. Ahead of the boat, upstream, no peaks were visible, nothing dramatic; the land just went slowly up, and up, and up. And Ferry Eight, now full of blatting and squawking and the quiet, intermittent voices of the country people, and smelling of manure, fried bread, fish, and sweet melons, moved slowly, her silent engines working hard against the drastic current, between wide rocky shores and treeless plains of thin, pale, plumy grass. Curtains of rain swept across the land, dropping from vast, quick clouds, and trailed off leaving sunlight, diamond air, the fragrance of the soil. Night was silent, cold, starlit. Sutty stayed up late and waked early. She came out on deck. The east was brightening. Over the shadowy western plains, dawn lit the far peaks one by one like matches. \\n The boat stopped where no town or village was, no sign of habitation. A woman in fleece tunic and felt hat crowded her flock onto the gangplank, and they ran ashore, she running with them, shouting curses at them and raucous goodbyes to friends aboard. From the aft rail Sutty watched the flock for miles, a shrinking pale blot on the grey-gold plain. All that ninth day passed in a trance of light. The boat moved slowly. The river, now clear as the wind, rushed by so silently that the boat seemed to float above it, between two airs. All around them were levels of rock and pale grass, pale distances. The mountains were lost, hidden by the vast swell of rising land. Land, and sky, and the river crossing from one to the other. \\n This is a longer journey, Sutty thought, standing again at the rail that evening, than my journey from Earth to Aka. \\n And she thought of Tong Ov, who might have made this journey himself and had given it to her to make, and wondered how to thank him. By seeing, by describing, by recording, yes. But she could not record her happiness. The word itself destroyed it. \\n She thought: Pao should be here. By me. She would have been here. We would have been happy. \\n The air darkened, the water held the light. \\n One other person was on deck. He was the only other passenger who had been on the boat all the way from the capital, a silent, fortyish man, a Corporation official in blue and tan. Uniforms were ubiquitous on Aka. Schoolchildren wore scarlet shorts and tunics: masses and lines and little hopping dots of brilliant red all over the streets of the cities, a startling, cheerful sight. College students wore green and rust. Blue and tan was the Sociocultural Bureau, which included the Central Ministry of Poetry and Art and the World Ministry of Information. Sutty was very familiar with blue and tan. Poets wore blue and tan—official poets, at any rate—and producers of tapes and neareals, and librarians, and bureaucrats in branches of the bureau with which Sutty was less familiar, such as Ethical Purity. The insignia on this man’s jacket identified him as a Monitor, fairly high in the hierarchy. When she was first aboard, expecting some kind of official presence or supervision, some watchdog watching her excursion, Sutty had waited for him to show some attention to her or evidence of keeping an eye on her. She saw nothing of the kind. If he knew who she was, nothing in his demeanor showed it. He had been entirely silent and aloof, ate at the captain’s table at meals, communicated only with his noter, and avoided the groups of talkers that she always joined. \\n Now he came to stand at the rail not far from her. She nodded and ignored him, which was what he had always appeared to want. \\n But he spoke, breaking the intense silence of the vast dusk landscape, where only the water murmured its resistance quietly and fiercely to the boat’s prow and sides. “A dreary country,” the Monitor said. \\n His voice roused a young eberdin tied to a stanchion nearby. It bleated softly, Ma-ma! and shook its head. \\n “Barren,” the man said. “Backward. Are you interested in lovers’ eyes?” \\n Ma-ma! said the little eberdin. \\n “Excuse me?” said Sutty. \\n “Lovers’ eyes. Gems, jewels.” \\n “Why are they called that?” \\n “Primitive fancy. Imagined resemblance.” The man’s glance crossed hers for a moment. In so far as she had thought anything about him at all, she had thought him stiff and dull, a little ego-crat. The cold keenness of his look surprised her. \\n “They’re found along stream banks, in the high country. Only there,” he said, pointing upstream, “and only on this planet. I take it some other interest brought you here.” \\n He did know who she was, then. And from his manner, he wished her to know that he disapproved of her being on the loose, on her own. \\n “In the short time I’ve been on Aka, I’ve seen only Dovza City. I received permission to do some sightseeing.” \\n “To go upriver,” the man said with a tight pseudo-smile. He waited for more. She felt a pressure from him, an expectancy, as if he considered her accountable to him. She resisted. \\n He gazed at the purplish plains fading into night and then down at the water that seemed still to hold some transparency of light within it. He said, “Dovza is a land of beautiful scenery. Rich farmlands, prosperous industries, delightful resorts in the South Headwaters Range. Having seen nothing of that, why did you choose to visit this desert?” \\n “I come from a desert,” Sutty said. \\n That shut him up for a bit. \\n “We know that Terra is a rich, progressive world.” His voice was dark with disapproval. \\n “Some of my world is fertile. Much of it is still barren. We have misused it badly…It’s a whole world, Monitor. With room enough for a lot of variety. Just as here.” \\n She heard the note of challenge in her voice. \\n “Yet you prefer barren places and backward methods of travel?” \\n This was not the exaggerated respect shown her by people in Dovza City, who had treated her as a fragile exotic that must be sheltered from reality. This was suspicion, distrust. He was telling her that aliens should not be allowed to wander about alone. The first xenophobia she’d met on Aka. \\n “I like boats,” she said, with care, pleasantly. “And I find this country beautiful. Austere but beautiful. Don’t you?” \\n “No,” he said, an order. No disagreement allowed. The corporate, official voice. \\n “So what brings you up the river? Are you looking for lovers’ eyes?” She spoke lightly, even a bit flirtily, allowing him to change tone and get out of the challenge-response mode if he wanted to. \\n He didn’t. “Business,” he said.  Vizdiat , the ultimate Akan justification, the inarguable aim, the bottom line. “There are pockets of cultural fossilisation and recalcitrant reactionary activity in this area. I hope you have no intention of traveling out of town into the high country. Where education has not yet reached, the natives are brutal and dangerous. In so far as I have jurisdiction in this area, I must ask you to remain in touch with my office at all times, to report any evidence of illegal practices, and to inform us if you plan to travel.” \\n “I appreciate your concern and shall endeavor to comply with your request,” Sutty said, straight out of  Advanced Exercises in Dovzan Usage and Locutions for Barbarians. \\n The Monitor nodded once, his eyes on the slowly passing, slowly darkening shore. When she looked again where he had stood he was gone. \\n ',\n",
       " 'THREE \\n THE WONDERFUL VOYAGE  of a ship climbing a river through a desert ended on the tenth day at Okzat-Ozkat. On the map the town had been a dot at the edge of an endless tangle of isobars, the High Headwaters Range. In the late evening it was a blur of whitish walls in the clear, cold darkness, dim horizontal windows set high, smells of dust and dung and rotten fruit and a dry sweetness of mountain air, a singsong of voices, the clatter of shod feet on stone. Scarcely any wheeled traffic. A gleam of rusty light shone on some kind of high, pale, distant wall, faintly visible above ornate roofs, against the last greenish clarity of the western sky. \\n Corporation announcements and music blared across the wharfs. That noise after ten days of quiet voices and river silence drove Sutty straight away. \\n No tour guide was waiting for her. Nobody followed her. Nobody asked her to show her ZIL. \\n Still in the passive trance of the journey, curious, nervous, alert, she wandered through the streets near the river till her shoulder bag began to drag her down and she felt the knife edge of the wind. In a dark, small street that ran uphill she stopped at a doorway. The house door was open, and a woman sat in a chair in the yellow light from within the house as if enjoying a balmy summer evening. \\n “Can you tell me where I might find an inn?” \\n “Here,” the woman said. She was crippled, Sutty saw now, with legs like sticks. “Ki!” she called. \\n A boy of fifteen or so appeared. Wordlessly he invited Sutty into the house. He showed her to a high-ceilinged, big, dark room on the ground floor, furnished with a rug. It was a magnificent rug, crimson eberdin wool with severe, complex, concentric patterns in black and white. The only other thing in the room was the light fixture, a peculiar, squarish bulb, quite dim, fixed between two high-set, horizontal windows. Its cord came snaking in one of the windows. \\n “Is there a bed?” \\n The boy gestured shyly to a curtain in the shadows of the far corner. \\n “Bath?” \\n He ducked his head toward a door. Sutty went and opened it. Three tiled steps went down to a little tiled room in which were various strange but interpretable devices of wood, metal, and ceramic, shining in the warm glow of an electric heater. \\n “It looks very nice,” she said. “How much is it?” \\n “Eleven haha,” the boy murmured. \\n “The night?” \\n “For a week.” The Akan week was ten days. \\n “Oh, that’s very nice,” Sutty said. “Thank you.” \\n Wrong. She should not have thanked him. Thanks were “servile address.” Honorifics and meaningless ritual phrases of greeting, leave-taking, permission-asking, and false gratitude, please, thank you, you’re welcome, goodbye, fossil relics of primitive hypocrisy—all were stumbling blocks to truthfulness between producer-consumers. She had learned that lesson, in those terms, almost as soon as she arrived. She had trained herself quite out of any such bad habits acquired on Earth. What had made the uncouth thanks jump now from her mouth? \\n The boy only murmured something which she had to ask him to repeat: an offer of dinner. She accepted without thanks. \\n In half an hour he brought a low table into her room, set with a figured cloth and dishes of dark-red porcelain. She had found cushions and a fat bedroll behind the curtain; had hung up her clothes on the bar and pegs also behind the curtain; had set her books and notebooks on the polished floor under the single light; and now sat on the carpet doing nothing. She liked the extraordinary sense of room in this room—space, height, stillness. \\n The boy served her a dinner of roast poultry, roast vegetables, a white grain that tasted like corn, and lukewarm, aromatic tea. She sat on the silky rug and ate it all. The boy looked in silently a couple of times to see if she needed anything. \\n “Tell me the name of this cereal, please.” No. Wrong. “But first, tell me your name.” \\n “Akidan,” he whispered. “That’s tuzi.” \\n “It’s very good. I never ate it before. Does it grow here?” \\n Akidan nodded. He had a strong, sweet face, still childish, but the man visible. “It’s good for the wood,” he murmured. \\n Sutty nodded sagely. “And delicious.” \\n “Thank you, yoz.” Yoz: a term defined by the Corporation as servile address and banned for the last fifty years at least. It meant, more or less, fellow person. Sutty had never heard the word spoken except on the tapes from which she had learned Akan languages back on Earth. And ‘good for the wood,’ was that an evil fossil of some kind too? She might find out tomorrow. Tonight she’d have a bath, unroll her bed, and sleep in the dark, blessed silence of this high place. \\n \\n A gentle knock, presumably by Akidan, guided her to breakfast waiting on the tray-table outside her door. There was a big piece of cut and seeded fruit, bits of something yellow and pungent in a saucer, a crumbly greyish cake, and a handleless mug of lukewarm tea, this time faintly bitter, with a taste she disliked at first but found increasingly satisfying. The fruit and bread were fresh and delicate. She left the yellow pickled bits. When the boy came to remove the tray, she asked the name of everything, for this food was entirely different from anything she had eaten in the capital, and it had been presented with significant care. The pickled thing was abid, Akidan said. “It’s for the early morning,” he said, “to help the sweet fruit.” \\n “So I should eat it?” \\n He smiled, embarrassed. “It helps to balance.” \\n “I see. I’ll eat it, then.” She ate it. Akidan seemed pleased. “I come from very far away, Akidan,” she said. \\n “Dovza City.” \\n “Farther. Another world. Terra of the Ekumen.” \\n “Ah.” \\n “So I’m ignorant about how to live here. I’d like to ask you lots of questions. Is that all right?” \\n He gave a little shrug-nod, very adolescent. Shy as he was, he was self-possessed. Whatever it meant to him, he accepted with aplomb the fact that an Observer of the Ekumen, an alien whom he could have expected to see only as an electronic image sent from the capital, was living in his house. Not a trace of the xenophobia she had diagnosed in the disagreeable man on the boat. \\n Akidan’s aunt, the crippled woman, who looked as if she was in constant low-level pain, spoke little and did not smile, but had the same tranquil, acceptant manner. Sutty arranged with her to stay two weeks, possibly longer. She had wondered if she was the only guest at the inn; now, finding her way about the house, she saw there was only one guest room. \\n In the city, at every hotel and apartment house, restaurant, shop, store, office, or bureau, every entrance and exit ran an automatic check of your personal ID chip, the all-important ZIL, the warranty of your existence as a producer-consumer entered in the data banks of the Corporation. Her ZIL had been issued her during the lengthy formalities of entrance at the spaceport. Without it, she had been warned, she had no identity on Aka. She could not hire a room or a robocab, buy food at a market or in a restaurant, or enter any public building without setting off an alarm. Most Akans had their chip embedded in the left wrist. She had taken the option of wearing hers in a fitted bracelet. Speaking with Akidan’s aunt in the little front office, she found herself looking around for the ZIL scanner, holding her left arm ready to make the universal gesture. But the woman pivoted her chair to a massive desk with dozens of small drawers in it. After quite a few tranquil mistakes and pauses to ponder, she found the drawer she wanted and extracted a dusty booklet of forms, one of which she tore off. She pivoted the chair back round and handed the form to Sutty to fill out by hand. It was so old that the paper was crumbly, but it did have a space for the ZIL code. \\n “Please, yoz, tell me how to address you,” Sutty said, another sentence from the  Advanced Exercises . \\n “My name is Iziezi. Please tell me how to address you, yoz and deyberienduin.” \\n Welcome-my-roof-under. A nice word. “My name is Sutty, yoz and kind innkeeper.” Invented for the occasion, but it seemed to serve the purpose. Iziezi’s thin, drawn face warmed faintly. When Sutty gave her the form back, she drew her clasped hands against her breastbone with a slight but very formal inclination of the head. A banned gesture if ever there was one. Sutty returned it. \\n As she left, Iziezi was putting the form book and the form Sutty had filled out into a desk drawer, not the same one. It looked as if the Corporation State was not going to know, for a few hours anyhow, exactly where individual /EX/HH 440 T 386733849 H 4/4939 was staying. \\n I’ve escaped the net, Sutty thought, and walked out into the sunshine. \\n Inside the house it was rather dim, all the horizontal windows being set very high up in the wall so that they showed nothing but fierce blue sky. Coming outdoors, she was dazzled. White house walls, glittering roof tiles, steep streets of dark slate flashing back the light. Above the roofs westward, as she began to be able to see again, she saw the highest of the white walls—immensely high—a wrinkled curtain of light halfway up the sky. She stood blinking, staring. Was it a cloud? A volcanic eruption? The Northern Lights in daytime? \\n “Mother,” said a small, toothless, dirt-colored man with a three-wheeled barrow, grinning at her from the street. \\n Sutty blinked at him. \\n “Ereha’s mother,” he said, and gestured at the wall of light. “Silong. Eh?” \\n Mount Silong. On the map, the highest point of the Headwaters Range and of the Great Continent of Aka. Yes. As they came up the river, the rise of the land had kept it hidden. Here you could see perhaps the upper half of it, a serrated radiance above which floated, still more remote, immense, ethereal, a horned peak half dissolved in golden light. From the summit streamed the thin snow-banners of eternal wind. \\n As she and the barrow man stood gazing, others stopped to help them gaze. That was the impression Sutty got. They all knew what Silong looked like and therefore could help her see it. They said its name and called it Mother, pointing to the glitter of the river down at the foot of the street. One of them said, “You might go to Silong, yoz?” \\n They were small, thin people, with the padded cheeks and narrow eyes of hill dwellers, bad teeth, patched clothes, thin, fine hands and feet coarsened by cold and injury. They were about the same color of brown she was. \\n “Go there?” She looked at them all smiling and could not help smiling. “Why?” \\n “On Silong you live forever,” said a gnarly woman with a backpack full of what looked like pumice rock. \\n “Caves,” said a man with a yellowish, scarred face. “Caves full of being.” \\n “Good sex!” said the barrow man, and everybody laughed. “Sex for three hundred years!” \\n “Its too high,” Sutty said, “how could anybody go there?” \\n They all grinned and said, “Fly!” \\n “Could a plane land on that?” \\n Cackles, headshakes. The gnarly woman said, “Nowhere,” the yellow man said, “No planes,” and the barrow man said, “After three-hundred-year sex, anybody can fly!” And then as they were all laughing they stopped, they wavered like shadows, they vanished, and nobody was there except the barrow man trundling his barrow halfway down the street, and Sutty staring at the Monitor. \\n On the ship she had not seen him as a big man, but here he loomed. His skin, his flesh, were different from that of the people here, smooth, tough, and even, like plastic. His blue-and-tan tunic and leggings were clean and smooth and like uniforms everywhere on every world, and he didn’t belong in Okzat-Ozkat any more than she did. He was an alien. \\n “Begging is illegal,” he said. \\n “I wasn’t begging.” \\n After a slight pause he said, “You misunderstand. Do not encourage beggars. They are parasites on the economy. Alms-giving is illegal.” \\n “No one was begging.” \\n He gave his short nod—all right then, consider yourself warned—and turned away. \\n “Thank you so much for your charm and courtesy!” Sutty said in her native language. Oh, wrong, wrong. She had no business being sarcastic in any language, even if the Monitor paid no attention. He was insufferable, but that did not excuse her. If she was to obtain any information here, she must stay in the good graces of local officialdom; if she was to learn anything here, she must not be judgmental. The old farfetchers’ motto:  Opinion ends reception.  Maybe those people had in fact been beggars, working her. How did she know? She knew nothing, nothing about this place, these people. \\n She set off to learn her way around Okzat-Ozkat with the humble determination not to have any opinions about it at all. \\n The modern buildings—prison, district and civic prefectures, agricultural, cultural, and mining agencies, teachers’ college, high school—looked like all such buildings in the other cities she’d seen: plain, massive blocks. Here they were only two or three stories high, but they loomed, the way the Monitor did. The rest of the city was small, subtle, dirty, fragile. Low house walls washed red or orange, horizontal windows set high under the eaves, roofs of red or olive-green tile with curlicues running up the angles and fantastic ceramic animals pulling up the corners in their toothy mouths; little shops, their outer and inner walls entirely covered with writing in the old ideographs, whitewashed over but showing through with a queer subliminal legibility. Steep slate-paved streets and steps leading up to locked doors painted red and blue and whitewashed over. Work yards where men made rope or cut stone. Narrow plots between houses where old women dug and hoed and weeded and changed the flow patterns of miniature irrigation systems. A few cars down by the docks and parked by the big white buildings, but the street traffic all on foot and by barrow and handcart. And, to Sutty’s delight, a caravan coming in from the country: big eberdin pulling two-wheeled carts with green-fringed tent tops, and two even bigger eberdin, the size of ponies, with bells tied in the creamy wool of their necks, each ridden by a woman in a long red coat sitting impassive in the high, horned saddle. \\n The caravan passed the facade of the District Prefecture, a tiny, jaunty, jingling scrap of the past creeping by under the blank gaze of the future. Inspirational music interspersed with exhortations blared from the roof of the Prefecture. Sutty followed the caravan for several blocks and watched it stop at the foot of one of the long flights of steps. People in the street also stopped, with that same amiable air of helping her watch, though they said nothing to her. People came out the high red and blue doors and down the steps to welcome the riders and carry in the luggage. A hotel? The owners’ townhouse? \\n She climbed back up to one of the shops she had passed in the higher part of town. If she had understood the signs around the door, the shop sold lotions, unguents, smells, and fertiliser. A purchase of hand cream might give her time to read some of the inscriptions that covered every wall from floor to ceiling, all in the old, the illegal writing. On the facade of the shop the inscriptions had been whitewashed out and painted over with signs in the modern alphabet, but these had faded enough that she could make out some of the underlying words. That was where she had made out “smells and fertiliser.” Probably perfumes and—what? Fertility? Fertility drugs, maybe? She went in. \\n She was at once engulfed in the smells—powerful, sweet, sharp, strange. A dim, pungent air. She had the curious sensation that the pictographs and ideograms that covered the walls with bold black and dark-blue shapes were moving, not jumpily like half-seen print but evenly, regularly, expanding and shrinking very gently, as if they were breathing. \\n The room was high, lighted by the usual high-set windows, and lined with cabinets full of little drawers. As her eyes adjusted, she saw that a thin old man stood behind a counter to her left. Behind his head two characters stood out quite clearly on the wall. She read them automatically, various of their various meanings arriving more or less at once:  eminent / peak / felt hat / look down / start up,  and  two / duality / sides / loins / join / separate. \\n “Yoz and deyberienduin, may I be of use to you?” \\n She asked if he had an unguent or lotion for dry skin. The proprietor nodded pleasantly and began seeking among his thousand little drawers with an air of peaceful certainty of eventually finding what he wanted, like Iziezi at her desk. \\n This gave Sutty time to read the walls, but that distracting illusion of movement continued, and she could not make much sense of the writings. They seemed not to be advertisements as she had assumed, but recipes, or charms, or quotations. A lot about branches and roots. A character she knew as blood, but written with a different Elemental qualifier, which might make it mean lymph, or sap. Formulas like “the five from the three, the three from the five.” Alchemy? Medicine, prescriptions, charms? All she knew was that these were old words, old meanings, that for the first time she was reading Aka’s past. And it made no sense. \\n To judge by his expression, the proprietor had found a drawer he liked. He gazed into it for some while with a satisfied look before he took an unglazed clay jar out of it and put it down on the counter. Then he went back to seeking gently among the rows of unlabeled drawers until he found another one he approved of. He opened it and gazed into it and, after a while, took out a gold-paper box. With this he disappeared into an inner room. Presently he came back with the box, a small, brightly glazed pot, and a spoon. He set them all down on the counter in a row. He spooned out something from the unglazed pot into the glazed pot, wiped the spoon with a red cloth he took from under the counter, mixed two spoonfuls of a fine, talc-like powder from the gold box into the glazed pot, and began to stir the mixture with the same unhurried patience. “It will make the bark quite smooth,” he said softly. \\n “The bark,” Sutty repeated. \\n He smiled and, setting down the spoon, smoothed one hand over the back of the other. \\n “The body is like a tree?” \\n “Ah,” he said, the way Akidan had said, “Ah.” It was a sound of assent, but qualified. It was yes but not quite yes. Or yes but we don’t use that word. Or yes but we don’t need to talk about that. Yes with a loophole. \\n “ In the dark cloud descending out of the sky…the forked…the twice-forked…  ?” Sutty said, trying to read a faded but magnificently written inscription high on the wall. \\n The proprietor slapped one hand loudly on the counter and the other over his mouth. \\n Sutty jumped. \\n They stared at each other. The old man lowered his hand. He seemed undisturbed, despite his startling reaction. He was perhaps smiling. “Not aloud, yoz,” he murmured. \\n Sutty went on staring for a moment, then shut her mouth. \\n “Just old decorations,” the proprietor said. “Old-fashioned wallpaper. Senseless dots and lines. Old-fashioned people live around here. They leave these old decorations around instead of painting walls clean and white. White and silent. Silence is snowfall. Now, yoz and honored customer, this ointment permits the skin to breathe mildly. Will you try it?” \\n She dipped a finger in the pot and spread the dab of pale cream on her hands. “Oh, very nice. And what a pleasant smell. What is it called?” \\n “The scent is the herb immimi, and the ointment is my secret, and the price is nothing.” \\n Sutty had picked up the pot and was admiring it; it was surely an old piece, enamel on heavy glass, with an elegantly fitted cap, a little jewel. “Oh, no, no, no,” she said, but the old man raised his clasped hands as Iziezi had done and bowed his head with such dignity that further protest was impossible. She repeated his gesture. Then she smiled and said, “Why?” \\n “ …the twice-forked lightning-tee grows up from earth, ” he said almost inaudibly. \\n After a moment she looked back up at the inscription and saw that it ended with the words he had spoken. Their eyes met again. Then he melted into the dim back part of the room and she was out on the street, blinking in the glare, clutching the gift. \\n Walking back down the steep, complicated streets to her inn, she pondered. It seemed that first the Mobile, then the Monitor, and now the Fertiliser, or whatever he was, had promptly and painlessly co-opted her, involving her in their intentions without telling her what they were. Go find the people who know the stories and report back to me, Tong said. Avoid dissident reactionaries and report back to me, said the Monitor. As for the Fertiliser, had he bribed her to be silent or rewarded her for speaking? The latter, she thought. But all she was certain of was that she was far too ignorant to do what she was doing without danger to herself or others. \\n The government of this world, to gain technological power and intellectual freedom, had outlawed the past. She did not underestimate the enmity of the Akan Corporation State toward the “old decorations” and what they meant. To this government who had declared they would be free of tradition, custom, and history, all old habits, ways, modes, manners, ideas, pieties were sources of pestilence, rotten corpses to be burned or buried. The writing that had preserved them was to be erased. \\n If the educational tapes and historical neareal dramas she had studied in the capital were factual, as she thought they were at least in part, within the lifetime of people now living, men and women had been crushed under the walls of temples, burned alive with books they tried to save, imprisoned for life for teaching anachronistic sedition and reactionary ideology. The tapes and dramas glorified this war against the past, relating the bombings, burnings, bulldozings in sternly heroic terms. Brave young men and women broke free from stupid parents, conniving priests, teachers of superstition, fomentors of reaction, and unflinchingly burned the pestilential forests of error, planting healthy orchards in their place—denounced the wicked professor who had hidden a dictionary of ideograms under his bed—blew up the monstrous hives where the poison of ignorance was stored—drove tractors through the flimsy rituals of superstition—and then, hand in hand, led their fellow producer-consumers to join the March to the Stars. \\n Behind the glib and bloated rhetoric lay real suffering, real passion. On both sides. Sutty knew that. She was a child of violence, as Tong Ov had said. Still she found it hard to keep in mind, and bitterly ironical, that here it was all the reverse of what she had known, the negative: that here the believers weren’t the persecutors but the persecuted. \\n But they were all true believers, both sides. Secular terrorists or holy terrorists, what difference? \\n The only thing she had found at all unusual in the endless propaganda from the Ministries of Information and Poetry was that the heroes of the exemplary tales usually came in pairs—a brother and sister, or a betrothed or married couple. If a sexual pair, heterosexual, always. The Akan government was obsessive in its detestation of ‘deviance.’ Tong had warned her about it as soon as she arrived: “We must conform. No discussion, no question is possible. Anything that can be seen and reported as a sexual advance to a person of the same sex is a capital offense. So tiresome, so sad. These poor people!” He sighed for the sufferings of bigots and puritans, the sufferings and cruelties. \\n She had scarcely needed his warning, since she had so little contact with people as individuals, but she had of course heeded it; and it had been an element of her early, severe disappointment, her discouragement. The old Akan usages and language she had learned on Earth had led her to think she was coming to a sexually easygoing society with little or no gender hierarchy. The society of her native corner of Earth had still been cramped by social and gender caste, further rigidified by Unist misogyny and intolerance. No place on Earth had been entirely out from under that shadow, not even the Pales. One of the reasons she had specialised in Aka, had learned the languages, was that she and Pao had read in the First Observers’ reports that Akan society was not hierarchically gendered and that heterosexuality was not compulsory, not even privileged. But all that had changed, changed utterly, during the years of her flight from Earth to Aka. Arriving here, she had had to go back to circumspection, caution, self-suppression. And danger. \\n So, then, why did they all so promptly try to enlist her, to use her? She was scarcely a jewel in anybody’s crown. \\n Tong’s reasons were superficially plain: he’d jumped at the first chance to send somebody out unsupervised, and chose her because she knew the old writing and language and would know what she found when she found it. But if she found it, what was she supposed to do with it? It was contraband. Illicit goods. Anti-Corporation sedition. Tong had said she was right to delete the fragments of the old books from the ansible transmission. Yet now he wanted her to record such material? \\n As for the Monitor, he was playing power games. It must be a thrill for a middle-weight supervisor of cultural correctness to find a genuine alien, an authentic Observer of the Ekumen, to give orders to: Don’t talk to social parasites—don’t leave town without permission—report to the boss man, me. \\n What about the Fertiliser? She could not shake the impression that he knew who she was, and that his gift had some meaning beyond courtesy to a stranger. No telling what. \\n Given her ignorance, if she let any of them control her, she might do harm. But if she tried to do anything bold and decisive on her own, she would almost certainly do harm. She must go slow, wait, watch, learn. \\n Tong had given her a code word to use in a message in case of trouble: ‘devolve.’ But he hadn’t really expected trouble. The Akans loved their alien guests, the cows from whom they milked the milk of high technology. They wouldn’t let her get into danger. She mustn’t paralyse herself with caution. \\n The Monitor’s rumbling about brutal tribespeople was bogey talk. Okzat-Ozkat was a safe, a touchingly safe place to live. It was a small, poor, provincial city, dragged along in the rough wake of Akan progress, far enough behind that it still held tattered remnants of the old way of life—the old civilisation. Probably the Corporation had consented to let an offworlder come here because it was so very out of the way, a harmless, picturesque bywater. Tong had sent her here to follow up a hunch or hope of finding under the monolithic, univocal success story of modern Aka some traces of what the Ekumen treasured: the singular character of a people, their way of being, their history. The Akan Corporation State wanted to forget, hide, ban, bury all that, and if she learned anything here, it would not please them. But the days of burying and burning alive were over. Weren’t they? The Monitor would bluster and bully, but what could he do? \\n Nothing much to her. A good deal, perhaps, to those who talked to her. \\n Hold still, she told herself. Listen. Listen to what they have to tell. \\n The air was dry at this altitude, cold in the shadow, hot in the sun. She stopped at a cafeteria near the Teachers’ College to buy a bottle of fruit juice and sat with it at a table outdoors. Cheery music, exhortations, news about crops, production statistics, health programs blared across the square from the loudspeakers as always. Somehow she had to learn to listen through that noise to what it hid, the meaning under it. \\n Was its ceaselessness its meaning? Were the Akans afraid of silence? \\n Nobody about her seemed to be afraid of anything. They were students in green-and-rust Education uniforms. Many had the padded cheekbones and delicate bone structure of the old street people here, but they were plump and shiny with youth and confidence, chattering and shouting across her without seeing her. Any woman over thirty was an alien to them. \\n They were eating the kind of food she had eaten in the capital, high-protein, sweet-salt packaged stuff, and drinking akakafi, a native hot drink rebaptized with a semi-Terran name. The Corporation brand of akakafi was called Starbrew and was ubiquitous. Bittersweet, black, it contained a remarkable mixture of alkaloids, stimulants, and depressants. Sutty loathed the taste, and it made her tongue furry, but she had learned to swallow it, since sharing akakafi was one of the few rituals of social bonding the people of Dovza City allowed themselves, and therefore very important to them. “A cup of akakafi?” they cried as soon as you came into the house, the office, the meeting. To refuse was to offer a rebuff, even an insult. Much small talk centered around akakafi: where to go for the best powder (not Starbrew, of course), where it was grown and processed, how to brew it. People boasted about how many cups they drank a day, as if the mild addiction were somehow praiseworthy. These young Educators were drinking it by the liter. \\n She listened to them dutifully, hearing chatter about examinations, prize lists, vacation travel. Nobody talked about reading or course material except two students nearby arguing about teaching preschoolers to use the toilet. The boy insisted that shame was the best incentive. The girl said, “Wipe it up and smile,” which annoyed the boy into giving quite a lecture on peer adjustment, ethical goal setting, and hygienic laxity. \\n Walking home, Sutty wondered if Aka was a guilt culture, a shame culture, or something all its own. How was it that everybody in the world was willing to move in the same direction, talk the same language, believe the same things? Fear of being evil, or fear of being different? \\n There she was, back with fear. Her problem, not theirs. \\n Her crippled hostess was sitting in the doorway when she got home. They greeted each other shyly with illegal civilities. Making conversation, Sutty said, “I like the teas you serve so much. Much better than akakafi.” \\n Iziezi didn’t slap one hand down and the other across her mouth, but her hands did move abruptly, and she said, “Ah,” exactly as the Fertiliser had said it. Then, after a long pause, cautiously, shortening the invented word, she said, “But akafi comes from your country.” \\n “Some people on Terra drink something like it. My people don’t.” \\n Iziezi looked tense. The subject was evidently fraught. \\n If every topic was a minefield, there was nothing to do but talk on through the blasts, Sutty thought. She said, “You don’t like it either?” \\n Iziezi screwed up her face. After a nervous silence she said earnestly, “It’s bad for people. It dries up the sap and disorders the flow. People who drink akafi, you can see their hands tremble and their heart jump. That’s what they used to say, anyhow. The old-time people. A long time ago. My grandmother. Now everybody drinks it. It was one of those old rules, you know. Not modern. Modern people like it.” \\n Caution; confusion; conviction. \\n “I didn’t like the breakfast tea at first, but then I did. What is it? What does it do?” \\n Iziezi’s face smoothed out. “That’s bezit. It starts the flow and reunites. It refreshes the liver a little, too.” \\n “You’re a…herb teacher,” Sutty said, not knowing the word for herbalist. \\n “Ah!” \\n A small mine going off. A small warning. \\n “Herb teachers are respected and honored in my homeland,” Sutty said. “Many of them are doctors.” \\n Iziezi said nothing, but gradually her face smoothed out again. \\n As Sutty turned to enter the house, the crippled woman said, “I’m going to exercise class in a few minutes.” \\n Exercises? Sutty thought, glancing at the immobile stick-shins that hung from Iziezi’s knees. \\n “If you haven’t found a class and would care to come…” \\n The Corporation was very strong on gymnastics. Everybody in Dovza City belonged to a gymnogroup and went to fitness classes. Several times a day brisk music and shouts of One! Two! blared from the loudspeakers, and whole factories and office buildings poured their producer-consumers out into streets and courtyards to jump and punch and bend and swing in vigorous unison. As a foreigner, Sutty had mostly succeeded in evading these groups; but she looked at Iziezi’s worn face and said, “I’d like to come.” \\n She went in to find a place of honor in her bathroom for the Fertiliser’s beautiful pot and to change from leggings into loose pants. When she came back out, Iziezi was transferring herself on crutches to a small powered wheelchair, Corporation issue, Starflight model. Sutty praised its design. Iziezi said dismissively, “It’s all right in flat places,” and took off, jolting and lurching up the steep, uneven street. Sutty walked alongside, lending a hand when the chair bucked and stuck, which it did about every two meters. They arrived at a low building with windows under the eaves and a high double door. One flap had been red and the other blue, with some kind of red-and-blue cloud motif painted above, now showing ghostly pink and grey through coats of whitewash. Iziezi headed her chair straight for the doors and barged them open. Sutty followed. \\n It seemed pitch-black inside. Sutty was getting used to these transitions from inside dark to outside dazzle and back, but her eyes weren’t. Just inside the door, Iziezi paused for Sutty to take her shoes off and set them on a shelf at the end of a dim row of shoes, all black canvas StarMarch issue, of course. Then Iziezi steered her chair at a fearless clip down a long ramp, parked it behind a bench, and levered herself around onto the bench. It seemed to be at the edge of a large matted area, beyond which all was velvet gloom. \\n Sutty was able to make out shadowy figures sitting here and there cross-legged on the mat. Near Iziezi on the bench sat a man with one leg. Iziezi got herself arranged, set down her crutches, and looked up at Sutty. She made a little patting gesture at the mat near her. The door had opened briefly as someone came in, and in the brief grey visibility, Sutty saw Iziezi smile. It was a lovely and touching sight. \\n Sutty sat down on the mat cross-legged with her hands in her lap. For a long time nothing else happened. It was, she thought, certainly unlike any exercise class she had ever seen, and far more to her taste. People came in silently, one or two at a time. As her eyes adjusted fully, she saw the room was vast. It must be almost entirely dug into the ground. Its long, low windows, right up where the wall met the ceiling, were of a thick bluish glass that let in only diffuse light. Above them the ceiling went on up in a low dome or series of arches; she could just make out dark, branching beams. She restrained her curious eyes and tried to sit, breathe, and not fall asleep. \\n Unfortunately, in her experience, sitting meditation and sleep had always tended to converge. When the man sitting nearest her began to swell and shrink like the ideograms on the Fertiliser’s shop wall, it roused only a dreamy interest in her. Then, sitting up a little straighter, she saw that he was raising his outstretched arms till the backs of his hands met above his head and then lowering them in a very slow, regular breath-rhythm. Iziezi and some others were doing the same, in more or less the same rhythm. The serene, soundless movements were like the pulsing of jellyfish in a dim aquarium. Sutty joined the pulsation. \\n Other motions were introduced here and there, one at a time, all arm movements, all in slow breath-rhythm. There would be periods of rest, and then the peaceful swelling and shrinking—stretch and relax, pulse out, draw in—would begin again, first one vague figure then another. A soft, soft sound accompanied the movements, a wordless rhythmic murmur, breath-music seemingly without source. Across the room one figure grew slowly up and up, whitish, undulant: a man or woman was afoot, making the arm gestures while bending forward or back or sideways from the waist. Two or three others rose in the same bonelessly supple way and stood reaching and swaying, never lifting a foot from the ground, more than ever like rooted sea creatures, anemones, a kelp forest, while the almost inaudible, ceaseless chanting pulsed like the sea swell, lifting and sinking… \\n Light, noise—a hard, loud, white blast as if the roof had been blown off. Bare square bulbs glared dangling from dusty vaultings. Sutty sat aghast as all around her people leapt to their feet and began to prance, kick, do jumping jacks, while a harsh voice shouted, “One! Two! One! Two! One! Two!” She stared round at Iziezi, who sat on her bench, jerking like a marionette, punching the air with her fists, one, two, one, two. The one-legged man next to her shouted out the beat, slamming his crutch against the bench in time. \\n Catching Sutty’s eye, Iziezi gestured, Up! \\n Sutty stood up, obedient but disgusted. To achieve such a beautiful group meditation and then destroy it with this stupid muscle building—what kind of people were these? \\n Two women in blue and tan were striding down the ramp after a man in blue and tan. The Monitor. His eyes went straight to her. \\n She stood among the others, who were all motionless now, except for the quick rise and fall of breath. \\n Nobody said anything. \\n The ban on servile address, on greetings, goodbyes, any phrase acknowledging presence or departure, left holes in the texture of social process, gaps crossed only by a slight effort, a recurrent strain. City Akans had grown up with the artificiality and no doubt did not feel it, but Sutty still did, and it seemed these people did too. The stiff silence enforced by the three standing on the ramp put the others at a disadvantage. They had no way to defuse it. The one-legged man at last cleared his throat and said with some bravado, “We are performing hygienic aerobic exercises as prescribed in the  Health Manual for Producer-Consumers of the Corporation .” \\n The two women with the Monitor looked at each other, bored, sour, I-told-you-so. The Monitor spoke to Sutty across the air between them as if no one else were there: “You came here to practice aerobics?” \\n “We have very similar exercises in my homeland,” she said, her dismay and indignation concentrating itself on him in a burst of eloquence. “I’m very glad to find a group here to practice them with. Exercise is often most profitable when performed with a sincerely interested group. Or so we believe in my homeland on Terra. And of course I hope to learn new exercises from my kind hosts here.” \\n The Monitor, with no acknowledgment of any kind except a moment’s pause, turned and followed the blue-and-tan women up the ramp. The women went out. He turned and stood just inside the doors, watching. \\n “Continue!” the one-legged man shouted. “One! Two! One! Two!” Everybody punched and kicked and bounced furiously for the next five or ten minutes. Sutty’s fury was genuine at first; then it boiled off with the silly exercises, and she wanted to laugh, to laugh off the shock. \\n She pushed Iziezi’s chair up the ramp, found her shoes among the row of shoes. The Monitor still stood there. She smiled at him. “You should join us,” she said. \\n His gaze was impersonal, appraising, entirely without response. The Corporation was looking at her. \\n She felt her face change, felt her eyes flick over him with dismissive incredulity as if seeing something small, uncouth, a petty monster. Wrong! wrong! But it was done. She was past him, outside in the cold evening air. \\n She kept hold of the chair back to help Iziezi zigzag bumpily down the street and to distract herself from the crazy surge of hatred the Monitor had roused in her. “I see what you mean about level ground,” she said. \\n “There’s no—level—ground,” Iziezi jerked out, holding on, but lifting one hand for a moment toward the vast verticalities of Silong, flaring white-gold over roofs and hills already drowned in dusk. \\n Back in the front hallway of the inn, Sutty said, “I hope I may join your exercise class again soon.” \\n Iziezi made a gesture that might have been polite assent or hopeless apology. \\n “I preferred the quieter part,” Sutty said. Getting no smile or response, she said, “I really would like to learn those movements. They’re beautiful. They felt as if they had a meaning in them.” \\n Iziezi still said nothing. \\n “Is there a book about them, maybe, that I could study?” The question seemed absurdly cautious yet foolishly rash. \\n Iziezi pointed into the common sitting room, where a vid/neareal monitor sat blank in one corner. Stacks of Corporation-issue tapes were piled next to it. In addition to the manuals, which everybody got a new set of annually, new tapes were frequently delivered to one’s door, informative, educational, admonitory, inspirational. Employees and students were frequently examined on them in regular and special sessions at work and in college.  Illness does not excuse ignorance!  blared the rich Corporational voice over vids of hospitalised workmen enthusiastically partissing in a neareal about plastic molding.  Wealth is work and work is wealth!  sang the chorus for the Capital-Labor instructional vid. Most of the literature Sutty had studied consisted of pieces of this kind in the poetic and inspirational style. She looked with malevolence at the piles of tapes. \\n “The health manual,” Iziezi murmured vaguely. \\n “I was thinking of something I could read in my room at night. A book.” \\n “Ah!” The mine went off very close this time. Then silence. “Yoz Sutty,” the crippled woman whispered, “books…” \\n Silence, laden. \\n “I don’t mean to put you at any risk.” \\n Sutty found herself, ridiculously, whispering. \\n Iziezi shrugged. Her shrug said, Risk, so, everything’s a risk. \\n “The Monitor seems to be following me.” \\n Iziezi made a gesture that said, No, no. “They come often to the class. We have a person to watch the street, turn the lights on. Then we…” Tiredly, she punched the air, One! Two! \\n “Tell me the penalties, yoz Iziezi.” \\n “For doing the old exercises? Get fined. Maybe lose your license. Maybe you just have to go to the Prefecture or the High School and study the manuals.” \\n “For a book? Owning it, reading it?” \\n “An…old book?” \\n Sutty made the gesture that said, Yes. \\n Iziezi was reluctant to answer. She looked down. She said finally, in a whisper, “Maybe a lot of trouble.” \\n Iziezi sat in her wheelchair. Sutty stood. The light had died out of the street entirely. High over the roofs the barrier wall of Silong glowed dull rust-orange. Above it, far and radiant, the peak still burned gold. \\n “I can read the old writing. I want to learn the old ways. But I don’t want you to lose your inn license, yoz Iziezi. Send me to somebody who isn’t her nephew’s sole support.” \\n “Akidan?” Iziezi said with new energy. “Oh, he’d take you right up to the Taproot!” Then she slapped one hand on the wheelchair arm and put the other over her mouth. “So much is forbidden,” she said from behind her hand, with a glance up at Sutty that was almost sly. \\n “And forgotten?” \\n “People remember…People know, yoz. But I don’t know anything. My sister knew. She was educated. I’m not. I know some people who are…educated…But how far do you want to go?” \\n “As far as my guides lead me in kindness,” Sutty said. It was a phrase not from the  Advanced Exercises in Grammar for Barbarians  but from the fragment of a book, the damaged page that had had on it the picture of a man fishing from a bridge and four lines of a poem: \\n Where my guides lead me in kindness \\n I follow, follow lightly, \\n and there are no footprints \\n in the dust behind us. \\n “Ah,” Iziezi said, not a land mine, but a long sigh. \\n ',\n",
       " 'FOUR \\n IF THE MONITOR  was keeping her under observation, she could go nowhere, learn nothing, without getting people into trouble. Possibly getting into trouble herself. And he was here to watch her; he had said so, if she’d only listened. It had taken all this time to dawn upon her that Corporation officials didn’t travel by boat. They flew in Corporation planes and helis. Her conviction of her own insignificance had kept her from understanding his presence and heeding his warning. \\n She hadn’t listened to what Tong Ov told her either: like it or not, admit it or not, she was important. She was the presence of the Ekumen on Aka. And the Monitor had told her, and she hadn’t listened, that the Corporation had authorised him to prevent the Ekumen—her—from investigating and revealing the continued existence of reactionary practices, rotten-corpse ideologies. \\n A dog in a graveyard, that’s how he saw her.  Keep far the Dog that’s friend to men, or with his nails he’ll dig it up again… \\n “Your heritage is Anglo-Hindic.” Uncle Hurree, with his wild white eyebrows and his sad, fiery eyes. “You must know Shakespeare and the Upanishads, Sutty. You must know the Gita and the Lake Poets.” \\n She did. She knew too many poets. She knew more poets, more poetry, she knew more grief, she knew more than anybody needed to know. So she had sought to be ignorant. To come to a place where she didn’t know anything. She had succeeded beyond all expectation. \\n After long pondering in her peaceful room, long indecision and anxiety, some moments of despair, she sent her first report to Tong Ov—and incidentally to the Office of Peace and Surveillance, the Sociocultural Ministry, and whatever other bureaus of the Corporation intercepted everything that came to Tong’s office. It took her two days to write two pages. She described her boat journey, the scenery, the city. She mentioned the excellent food and fine mountain air. She requested a prolongation of her holiday, which had proved both enjoyable and educational, though hampered by the well-intended but overprotective zeal of an official who thought it necessary to insulate her from conversations and interactions with the local people. \\n The corporative government of Aka, while driven to control everyone and everything, also wanted very much to please and impress their visitors from the Ekumen. To  measure up , as Uncle Hurree would have said. The Envoy was expert at using that second motive to limit the first; but her message could cause him problems. They had let him send an Observer into a ‘primitive’ area, but they had sent an observer of their own to observe the Observer. \\n She waited for Tong’s reply, increasingly certain that he would be forced to call her back to the capital. The thought of Dovza City made her realise how much she did not want to leave the little city, the high country. For three days she went on hikes out into the farmlands and up along the bank of the glacier-blue, rowdy young river, sketched Silong above the curlicued roofs of Okzat-Ozkat, entered Iziezi’s recipes for her exquisite food in her noter but did not return to ‘exercise class’ with her, talked with Akidan about his schoolwork and sports but did not talk to any strangers or street people, was studiously touristic and innocuous. \\n Since she came to Okzat-Ozkat, she had slept well, without the long memory-excursions that had broken her nights in Dovza City; but during this time of waiting she woke every night in the depths of the darkness and was back in the Pale. \\n The first night, she was in the tiny living room of her parents’ flat, watching Dalzul on the neareal. Father, a neurologist, abominated vr-proprios. “Lying to the body is worse than torturing it,” he growled, looking like Uncle Hurree. He had long ago disconnected the vr modules from their set, so that it functioned merely as a holo TV. Having grown up in the village with no commtech but radios and an ancient 2D television in the town meeting hall, Sutty didn’t miss vr-prop. She had been studying, but turned her chair round to see the Envoy of the Ekumen standing on the balcony of the Sanctum, flanked by the white-robed Fathers. \\n The Fathers’ mirror masks reflected the immense throng, hundreds of thousands of people gathered in the Great Square, as a tiny dappling. Sunlight shone on Dalzul’s bright, amazing hair. The Angel, they called him now, God’s Herald, the Divine Messenger. Mother scoffed and grumbled at such terms, but she watched him as intently, listened to his words as devoutly as any Unist, as anybody, everybody in the world. How did Dalzul bring hope to the faithful and hope to the unbelievers at the same time, in the same words? \\n “I want to distrust him,” Mother said. “But I can’t. He is going to do it—to put the Meliorist Fathers into power. Incredible! He is going to set us free.” \\n Sutty had no trouble believing it. She knew, from Uncle Hurree and from school and from her own apparently innate conviction, that the Rule of the Fathers under which she had lived all her life had been a fit of madness. Unism was a panic response to the great famines and epidemics, a spasm of global guilt and hysterical expiation, which had been working itself into its final orgy of violence when Dalzul the “Angel” came from “Heaven” and with his magic oratory turned all that zeal from destruction to loving-kindness, from mass murder to mild embrace. A matter of timing; a tip of the balance. Wise with the wisdom of Hainish teachers who had been through such episodes a thousand times in their endless history, canny as his white Terran ancestors who had convinced everybody else on Earth that their way was the only way, Dalzul had only to set his finger on the scales to turn blind, bigoted hatred into blind, universal love. And now peace and reason would return, and Terra would regain her place among the peaceful, reasonable worlds of the Ekumen. Sutty was twenty-three and had no trouble believing it at all. \\n Freedom Day, the day they opened the Pale: the restrictions on unbelievers lifted, all the restrictions on communications, books, women’s clothing, travel, worship and nonworship, everything. The people of the Pale came pouring out of the shops and houses, the high schools and the training schools into the rainy streets of Vancouver. \\n They didn’t know what to do, really, they had lived so long silent, demure, cautious, humble, while the Fathers preached and ruled and ranted and the Officers of the Faith confiscated, censored, threatened, punished. It had always been the faithful who gathered in huge crowds, shouted praises, sang songs, celebrated, marched here and marched there, while the unbelievers lay low and talked soft. But the rain let up, and people brought guitars and sitars and saxophones out into the streets and squares and began playing music and dancing. The sun came out, low and gold under big clouds, and they went on dancing the joyous dances of unbelief. In McKenzie Square there was a girl leading a round dance, black heavy glossy hair, ivory skin, Sino-Canadian, laughing, a noisy, laughing girl, too loud, brassy, self-confident, but Sutty joined her round dance because the people in it were having such a good time and the boy playing the concertina made such terrific music. She and the black-haired girl came face to face in some figure of the dance they had just invented. They took each other’s hands. One laughed, and the other laughed. They never let go of each other’s hands all night. \\n From that memory Sutty plunged soft and straight into sleep, the untroubled sleep she almost always had in this high, quiet room. \\n Next day she hiked a long way up the river, came back late and tired. She ate with Iziezi, read a while, unrolled her bed. \\n As soon as she turned the light off and lay down, she was back in Vancouver, the day after freedom. \\n They had gone for a walk up above the city in New Stanley Park, the two of them. There were still some big trees there, enormous trees from before the pollution. Firs, Pao said. Douglas firs, and spruce, they were called. Once the mountains had been black with them. “Black with them!” she said in her husky, unmodulated voice, and Sutty saw the great black forests, the heavy, glossy black hair. \\n “You grew up here?” she asked, for they had everything to learn about each other, and Pao said, “Yes I did, and now I want to get out!” \\n “Where to?” \\n “Hain, Ve, Chiffewar, Werel, Yeowe-Werel, Gethen, Urras-Anarres, O!” \\n “O, O, O!” Sutty crowed, laughing and half crying to hear her own litany, her secret mantra shouted out loud. “I do too! I will, I will, I’m going!” \\n “Are you in training?” \\n “Third year.” \\n “I just started.” \\n “Catch up!” Sutty said. \\n And Pao almost did so. She got through three years of work in two. Sutty graduated after the first of those years and stayed on the second as a graduate associate, teaching deep grammar and Hainish to beginning students. When she went to the Ekumenical School in Valparaiso, she and Pao would be apart only eight months; and she would fly back up to Vancouver for the December holiday, so they’d only actually be separated for four months and then four months again, and then together, together all the way through the Ekumenical School, and all the rest of their lives, all over the Known Worlds. “We’ll be making love on a world nobody even knows the name of now, a thousand years from now!” Pao said, and laughed her lovely chortling laugh that started down inside her belly, in what she called her tan-tien-tummy, and ended up rocking her to and fro. She loved to laugh, she loved to tell jokes and be told them. Sometimes she laughed out loud in her sleep. Sutty would feel and hear the soft laughter in the darkness, and in the morning Pao would explain that her dreams had been so funny, and laugh again trying to tell the funny dreams. \\n They lived in the flat they’d found and moved into two weeks after freedom, the dear grubby basement flat on Souché Street, Sushi Street because there were three Japanese restaurants on it. They had two rooms: one with wall-to-wall futons, one with the stove, the sink, and the upright piano with four dead keys that came with the flat because it was too far gone to repair and too expensive to move. Pao played crashing waltzes with holes in them while Sutty cooked bhaigan tamatar. Sutty recited the poems of Esnanaridaratha of Darranda and filched almonds while Pao fried rice. A mouse gave birth to infant mice in the storage cabinet. Long discussions about what to do about the infant mice ensued. Ethnic slurs were exchanged: the ruthlessness of the Chinese, who treated animals as insentient, the wickedness of the Hindus, who fed sacred cows and let children starve. “I will not live with mice!” Pao shouted. “I will not live with a murderer!” Sutty shouted back. The infant mice became adolescents and began making forays. Sutty bought a secondhand box trap. They baited it with tofu. They caught the mice one by one and released them in New Stanley Park. The mother mouse was the last to be caught, and when they released her they sang: \\n God will bless thee, loving mother \\n Of thy faithful husband’s child, \\n Cling to him and know no other, \\n Living pure and undefiled. \\n Pao knew a lot of Unist hymns, and had one for most occasions. \\n Sutty got the flu. Flu was a frightening thing, so many strains of it were fatal. She remembered vividly her terror, standing in the crowded streetcar while the headache got worse and worse, and when she got home and couldn’t focus her eyes on Pao’s face. Pao cared for her night and day and when the fever went down made her drink Chinese medicinal teas that tasted like piss and mildew. She was weak for days and days, lying there on the futons staring at the dingy ceiling, weak and stupid, peaceful, coming back to life. \\n But in that epidemic little Aunty found her way back to the village. The first time Sutty was strong enough to visit home, it was strange to be there with Mother and Father and not with Aunty. She kept turning her head, thinking Aunty was standing in the doorway or sitting in her chair in the other room in her ragged blanket cocoon. Mother gave Sutty Aunty’s bangles, the six everyday brass ones, the two gold ones for dressing up, tiny, frail circlets through which Sutty’s hands would never pass. She gave them to Lakshmi for her baby girl to wear when she got bigger. “Don’t hold on to things, they weigh you down. Keep in your head what’s worth keeping,” Uncle Hurree had said, preaching what he’d had to practice; but Sutty kept the red-and-orange saree of cotton gauze, which folded up into nothing and could not weigh her down. It was in the bottom of her suitcase here, in Okzat-Ozkat. Someday maybe she would show it to Iziezi. Tell her about Aunty. Show her how you wore a saree. Most women enjoyed that and liked to try it on themselves. Pao had tried on Sutty’s old grey-and-silver saree once, to entertain Sutty while she was convalescing, but she said it felt too much like skirts, which of course she had been forced to wear in public all her life because of the Unist clothing laws, and she couldn’t get the trick of securing the top. “My tits are going to pop out!” she cried, and then, encouraging them to do so, had performed a remarkable version of what she called Indian classical dance all over the futons. \\n Sutty had been frightened again, very badly frightened, when she discovered that everything she’d learned in the months before she got the flu—the Ekumenical history, the poems she’d memorised, even simple words of Hainish she had known for years—seemed to have been wiped out. “What will I do, what will I do, if I can’t keep things even in my head?” she whispered to Pao, when she finally broke down and confessed to the terror that had been tormenting her for a week. Pao hadn’t comforted her much, just let her tell her fear and misery, and finally said, “I think that will wear off. I think you’ll find it all coming back.” And of course she was right. Talking about it changed it. The next day, as Sutty was riding the streetcar, the opening lines  of The Terraces of Darranda  suddenly flowered out in her mind like great fireworks, the marvelous impetuous orderly fiery words; and she knew that all the other Words were there, not lost, waiting in the darkness, ready to come when she called them. She bought a huge bunch of daisies and took them home for Pao. They put them in the one vase they had, black plastic, and they looked like Pao, black and white and gold. With the vision of those flowers an intense and complete awareness of Pao’s body and presence filled her now, here in the high quiet room on another world, as it had filled her constantly there, then, when she was with Pao, and when she wasn’t with her, but there was no time that they weren’t together, no time that they were truly apart, not even that long, long flight down all the coast of the Americas had separated them. Nothing had separated them.  Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediment …“O my true mind,” she whispered in the dark, and felt the warm arms holding her before she slept. \\n \\n Tong Ov’s brief reply came, a printout, received at a bureau of the District Prefecture and hand-delivered, after inspection of her ZIL bracelet, by a uniformed messenger.  Observer Sutty Dass: Consider your holiday the beginning of a field trip. Continue research and recording personal observations as you see fit. \\n So much for the Monitor! Surprised and jubilant, Sutty went outdoors to look up at the bannered peak of Silong and think where to start. \\n She had gathered in her mind innumerable things to learn about: the meditation exercises; the double-cloud doors, which she had found all over the city, always whitewashed or painted over; the inscriptions in shops; the tree metaphors she kept hearing in talk about food or health or anything to do with the body; the possible existence of banned books; the certain existence of a web or net of information, subtler than the electronic one and uncontrolled by the Corporation, that kept people all over the city in touch and aware at all times of, for instance, Sutty: who she was, where she was, what she wanted. She saw this awareness in the eyes of street people, shopkeepers, schoolchildren, the old women who dug in the little gardens, the old men who sat in the sun on barrels on street corners. She felt it as uninvasive, as if she walked among faint lines of guidance, not bonds, not constraints, but reassurances. That she had not first entered either Iziezi’s or the Fertiliser’s door entirely by chance now seemed probable, though she could not explain it, and acceptable, though she did not know why. \\n Now that she was free, she wanted to go back to the Fertiliser’s shop. She went up into the hills of the city, began to climb that narrow street. Halfway up it she came face to face with the Monitor. \\n Released from concern about either obeying or evading him, she looked at him as she had at first on the river journey, not as the object of bureaucratic control looks at the bureaucrat, but humanly. He had a straight back and good features, though ambition, anxiety, authority had made his face hard, tight. Nobody starts out that way, Sutty thought. There are no hard babies. Magnanimous, she greeted him, “Good morning, Monitor!” \\n Her cheery, foolish voice rang in her own ears. Wrong, wrong. To him such a greeting was mere provocation. He stood silent, facing her. \\n He cleared his throat and said, “I have been ordered to withdraw my request to you to inform my office of your contacts and travel plans. Since you did not comply with it, I attempted to keep some protective surveillance over you. I am informed that you complained of this. I apologise for any annoyance or inconvenience caused you by myself or my staff.” \\n His tone was cold and dour but he had some dignity, and Sutty, ashamed, said, “No—I’m sorry, I—” \\n “I warn you,” he said, paying no attention, his voice more intense, “that there are people here who intend to use you for their own ends. These people are not picturesque relics of a time gone by. They are not harmless. They are vicious. They are the dregs of a deadly poison—the drug that stupefied my people for ten thousand years. They seek to drag us back into that paralysis, that mindless barbarism. They may treat you kindly, but I tell you they are ruthless. You are a prize to them. They’ll flatter you, teach you lies, promise you miracles. They are the enemies of truth, of science. Their so-called knowledge is rant, superstition, poetry. Their practices are illegal, their books and rites are banned, and you know that. Do not put my people into the painful position of finding a scientist of the Ekumen in possession of illegal materials—participating in obscene, unlawful rites. I ask this of you—as a scientist of the Ekumen—” He had begun to stammer, groping for words. \\n Sutty looked at him, finding his emotion unnerving, grotesque. She said drily, “I am not a scientist. I read poetry. And you need not tell me the evils religion can do. I know them.” \\n “No,” he said, “you do not.” His hands clenched and unclenched. “You know nothing of what we were. How far we have come. We will never go back to barbarism.” \\n “Do you know anything at all about my world?” she said with incredulous scorn. Then none of this talk seemed worthwhile to her, and she only wanted to get away from the zealot. “I assure you that no representative of the Ekumen will interfere in Akan concerns unless explicitly asked to do so,” she said. \\n He looked straight at her and spoke with extraordinary passion. “Do not betray us!” \\n “I have no intention—” \\n He turned his head aside as if in denial or pain. Abruptly he walked on past her, down the street. \\n She felt a wave of hatred for him that frightened her. \\n She turned and went on, telling herself that she should be sorry for him. He was sincere. Most bigots are sincere. The stupid, arrogant fool, trying to tell her that religion was dangerous! But he was merely parroting Dovzan propaganda. Trying to frighten her, angry because his superiors had put him in the wrong. That he couldn’t control her was so intolerable to him that he’d lost control of himself. There was absolutely no need to think about him any more. \\n She walked on up the street to the little shop to ask the Fertiliser what the double-cloud doors were, as she had intended. \\n When she entered, the high dim room with its word-covered walls seemed part of a different reality altogether. She stood there for a minute, letting that reality become hers. She looked up at the inscription:  In the dark cloud’s descent from sky the twice-forked lightning-tree grows up from earth. \\n The elegant little pot the Fertiliser had given her bore a motif that she had taken to be a stylised shrub or tree before she saw that it might be a variation on the cloud-door shape. She had sketched the design from the pot. When the Fertiliser materialised from the dark backward and abysm of his shop, she put her sketch down on the counter and said, “Please, yoz, can you tell me what this design is?” \\n He studied the drawing. He observed in his thin, dry voice, “It’s a very pretty drawing.” \\n “It’s from the gift you gave me. Has the design a meaning, a significance?” \\n “Why do you ask, yoz?” \\n “I’m interested in old things. Old words, old ways.” \\n He watched her with age-faded eyes and said nothing. \\n “Your government”—she used the old word,  biedins , ‘system of officials,’ rather than the modern  vizdestit , ‘joint business’ or ‘corporation’—“Your government, I know, prefers that its people learn new ways, not dwelling on their past.” Again she used the old word for people, not  riyingdutey , producer-consumers. “But the historians of the Ekumen are interested in everything that our member worlds have to teach, and we believe that a useful knowledge of the present is rooted in the past.” \\n The Fertiliser listened, affably impassive. \\n She forged ahead. “I’ve been asked by the official senior to me in the capital to learn what I can about some of the old ways that no longer exist in the capital, the arts and beliefs and customs that flourished on Aka before my people came here. I’ve received assurance from a Sociocultural Monitor that his office won’t interfere with my studies.” She said the last sentence with a certain vengeful relish. She still felt shaken, sore, from her confrontation with the Monitor. But the peacefulness in this place, the dim air, the faint scents, the half-visible ancient writings, made all that seem far away. \\n A pause. The old man’s thin forefinger hovered over the design she had drawn. “We do not see the roots,” he said. \\n She listened. \\n “The trunk of the tree,” he said, indicating the element of the design that, in a building, was the double-leafed door. “The branches and foliage of the tree, the crown of leaves.” He indicated the five-lobed ‘cloud’ that rose above the trunk. “Also this is the body, you see, yoz.” He touched his own hips and sides, patted his head with a certain leafy motion of the fingers, and smiled a little. “The body is the body of the world. The world’s body is my body. So, then, the one makes two.” His finger showed where the trunk divided. “And the two bear each three branches, that rejoin, making five.” His finger moved to the five lobes of foliage. “And the five bear the myriad, the leaves and flowers that die and return, return and die. The beings, creatures, stars. The being that can be told. But we don’t see the roots. We cannot tell them.” \\n “The roots are in the ground…?” \\n “The mountain is the root.” He made a beautiful formal gesture, the backs of his fingers touching at the tip to shape a peak, then moving in to touch his breast over his heart. \\n “The mountain is the root,” she repeated. “These are mysteries.” \\n He was silent. \\n “Can you tell me more? Tell me about the two, and the three, and the five, yoz.” \\n “These are things that take a long time to tell, yoz.” \\n “My time is all for listening. But I don’t want to waste yours, or intrude on it. Or ask you to tell me anything you don’t want to tell me, anything better kept secret.” \\n “Everything’s kept secret now,” he said in that papery voice. “And yet it’s all in plain sight.” He looked round at the cases of little drawers and the walls above them entirely covered with words, charms, poems, formulas. Today in Sutty’s eyes the ideograms did not swell and shrink, did not breathe, but rested motionless on the high, dim walls. “But to so many they aren’t words, only old scratches. So the police leave them alone…In my mother’s time, all children could read. They could begin to read the story. The telling never stopped. In the forests and the mountains, in the villages and the cities, they were telling the story, telling it aloud, reading it aloud. Yet it was all secret then too. The mystery of the beginning, of the roots of the world, the dark. The grave, yoz. Where it begins.” \\n So her education began. Though later she thought it had truly begun when she sat at the little tray-table in her room in Iziezi’s house, with the first taste of that food on her tongue. \\n \\n One of the historians of Darranda said:  To learn a belief without belief is to sing a song without the tune. \\n A yielding, an obedience, a willingness to accept these notes as the right notes, this pattern as the true pattern, is the essential gesture of performance, translation, and understanding. The gesture need not be permanent, a lasting posture of the mind or heart; yet it is not false. It is more than the suspension of disbelief needed to watch a play, yet less than a conversion. It is a position, a posture in the dance. So Sutty’s teachers, gathered from many worlds to the city Valparaíso de Chile, had taught her, and she had had no cause to question their teaching. \\n She had come to Aka to learn how to sing this world’s tune, to dance its dance; and at last, she thought, away from the city’s endless noise, she was beginning to hear the music and to learn how to move to it. \\n Day after day she recorded her notes, observations that stumbled over each other, contradicted, amplified, backtracked, speculated, a wild profusion of information on all sorts of subjects, a jumbled and jigsawed map that for all its complexity represented only a rough sketch of one corner of the vastness she had to explore: a way of thinking and living developed and elaborated over thousands of years by the vast majority of human beings on this world, an enormous interlocking system of symbols, metaphors, correspondences, theories, cosmology, cooking, calisthenics, physics, metaphysics, metallurgy, medicine, physiology, psychology, alchemy, chemistry, calligraphy, numerology, herbalism, diet, legend, parable, poetry, history, and story. \\n In this vast mental wilderness she looked for paths and signs, institutions that could be described, ideas that could be defined. Instinctively she avoided great cloudy concepts and sought tangibilities, such as architecture. The buildings in Okzat-Ozkat with the double doors that represented the Tree had been temples,  umyazu , a word now banned, a nonword. Nonwords were useful markers of paths that might lead through the wilderness. Was ‘temple’ the best translation? What had gone on in the umyazu? \\n Well, people said, people used to go there and listen. \\n To what? \\n Oh, well, the stories, you know. \\n Who told the stories? \\n Oh, the maz did. They lived there. Some of them. \\n Sutty gathered that the umyazu had been something like monasteries, something like churches, and very much like libraries: places where professionals gathered and kept books and people came to learn to read them, to read them, and to hear them read. In richer areas, there had been great, rich umyazu, to which people went on pilgrimage to see the treasures of the library and ‘hear the Telling.’ These had all been destroyed, pulled down or blown up, except the oldest and most famous of all, the Golden Mountain, far to the east. \\n From an official neareal she had partissed in while she was in Dovza City, she knew that the Golden Mountain had been made into a Corporate Site for the worship of the God of Reason: an artificial cult that had no existence except at this tourist center and in slogans and vague pronouncements of the Corporation. The Golden Mountain had been gutted, first, however. The neareal showed scenes of books being removed from a great underground archive by machinery, big scoops shoveling books up like dirt into dump trucks, backhoes ramming and scraping books into a landfill. The viewer of the neareal partissed in the operation of one of these machines, while lively, bouncy music played. Sutty had stopped the neareal in the midst of this scene and disconnected the vr-proprios from the set. After that she had watched and listened to Corporation neareals but never partissed in one again, though she reconnected the vr-p modules every day when she left her special research cubicle at the Central Ministry of Poetry and Art. \\n Memories such as that inclined her to some sympathy with this religion, or whatever it was she was studying, but caution and suspicion balanced her view. It was her job to avoid opinion and theory, stick to evidence and observation, listen and record what she was told. \\n Despite the fact that it was all banned, all illicit, people talked to her quite freely, trustfully answering her questions. She had no trouble finding out about the yearlong and lifelong cycles and patterns of feasts, fasts, indulgences, abstinences, passages, festivals. These observances, which seemed in a general way to resemble the practices of most of the religions she knew anything about, were now of course subterranean, hidden away, or so intricately and unobtrusively woven into the fabric of ordinary life that the Monitors of the Sociocultural Office couldn’t put their finger on any act and say, “This is forbidden.” \\n The menus of the little restaurants for working people in Okzat-Ozkat were a nice example of this kind of obscurely flourishing survival of illicit practices. The menu was written up in the modern alphabet on a board at the door. Along with akakafi, it featured the foods produced by the Corporation and advertised, distributed, and sold all over Aka by the Bureau of Public Health and Nutrition: produce from the great agrifactories, high-protein, vitamin-enriched, packaged, needing only heating. The restaurants kept some of these things in stock, freeze-dried, canned, or frozen, and a few people ordered them. Most people who came to these little places ordered nothing. They sat down, greeted the waiter, and waited to be served the fresh food and drink that was appropriate to the day, the time of day, the season, and the weather, according to an immemorial theory and practice of diet, the goal of which was to live long and well with a good digestion. Or with a peaceful heart. The two phrases were the same in Rangma, the local language. \\n In her noter in one of her long evening recording sessions, late in the autumn, sitting on the red rug in her quiet room, she defined the Akan system as a religion-philosophy of the type of Buddhism or Taoism, which she had learned about during her Terran education: what the Hainish, with their passion for lists and categories, called a religion of process. “There are no native Akan words for God, gods, the divine,” she told her noter. “The Corporation bureaucrats made up a word for God and installed state theism when they learned that a concept of deity was important on the worlds they took as models. They saw that religion is a useful tool for those in power. But there was no native theism or deism here. On Aka,  god  is a word without referent. No capital letters. No creator, only creation. No eternal father to reward and punish, justify injustice, ordain cruelty, offer salvation. Eternity not an endpoint but a continuity. Primal division of being into material and spiritual only as two-as-one, or one in two aspects. No hierarchy of Nature and Supernatural. No binary Dark/Light, Evil/ Good, or Body/Soul. No afterlife, no rebirth, no immortal disembodied or reincarnated soul. No heavens, no hells. The Akan system is a spiritual discipline with spiritual goals, but they’re exactly the same goals it seeks for bodily and ethical well-being. Right action is its own end. Dharma without karma.” \\n She had arrived at a definition of Akan religion. For a minute she was perfectly satisfied with it and with herself. \\n Then she found she was thinking about a group of myths that Ottiar Uming had been telling. The central figure, Ezid, a strange, romantic character who appeared sometimes as a beautiful, gentle young man and sometimes as a beautiful, fearless young woman, was called “the Immortal.” She added a note: “What about ‘Immortal Ezid’? Does this imply belief in an afterlife? Is Ezid one person, two, or many?  Immortal/living-forever  seems to mean: intense, repeated many times, famous, perhaps also a special ‘educated’ meaning: in perfect bodily/spiritual health, living wisely. Check this.” \\n Again and again in her notes, after every conclusion:  Check this.  Conclusions led to new beginnings. Terms changed, were corrected, recorrected. Before long she became unhappy with her definition of the system as a religion; it seemed not incorrect, but not wholly adequate. The term  philosophy  was even less adequate. She went back to calling it the system, the Great System. Later she called it the Forest, because she learned that in ancient times it had been called the way through the forest. She called it the Mountain when she found that some of her teachers called what they taught her the way to the mountain. She ended up calling it the Telling. But that was after she came to know Maz Elyed. \\n She had long debates with her noter about whether any word in Dovzan, or in the older and partly non-Dovzan vocabulary used by ‘educated’ people, could be said to mean sacred or holy. There were words she translated as power, mystery, not-controlled-by-people, part-of-harmony. These terms were never reserved for a certain place or type of action. Rather it appeared that in the old Akan way of thinking any place, any act, if properly perceived, was actually mysterious and powerful, potentially sacred. And perception seemed to involve description—telling about the place, or the act, or the event, or the person. Talking about it, making it into a story. \\n But these stories weren’t gospel. They weren’t Truth. They were essays at the truth. Glances, glimpses of sacredness. One was not asked to believe, only to listen. \\n “Well, that’s how I learned the story,” they would say, having told a parable or recounted a historical episode or recited an ancient and familiar legend. “Well, that’s the way this telling goes.” \\n The holy people in their stories achieved holiness, if that was what it was, by all kinds of different means, none of which seemed particularly holy to Sutty. There were no rules, such as poverty chastity obedience, or exchanging one’s worldly goods for a wooden begging bowl, or reclusion on a mountaintop. Some of the heroes and famous maz in the stories were flamboyantly rich; their virtue had apparently consisted in generosity—building great beautiful umyazu to house their treasures, or going on processions with hundreds of companions all mounted on eberdin with silver harnesses. Some of the heroes were warriors, some were powerful leaders, some were shoemakers, some were shopkeepers. Some of the holy people in the stories were passionate lovers, and the story was about their passion. A lot of them were couples. There were no rules. There was always an alternative. The story-tellers, when they commented on the legends and histories they told, might point out that that had been a good way or a right way of doing something, but they never talked about  the  right way. And good was an adjective, always: good food, good health, good sex, good weather. No capital letters. Good or Evil as entities, warring powers, never. \\n This system wasn’t a religion at all, Sutty told her noter with increasing enthusiasm. Of course it had a spiritual dimension. In fact, it  was  the spiritual dimension of life for those who lived it. But religion as an institution demanding belief and claiming authority, religion as a community shaped by a knowledge of foreign deities or competing institutions, had never existed on Aka. \\n Until, perhaps, the present time. \\n Aka’s habitable lands were a single huge continent with an immensely long archipelago off its eastern coast. Dovza was the farthest southwestern region of the great continent. Undivided by oceans, the Akans were physically all of one type with slight local variations. All the Observers had remarked on this, all had pointed out the ethnic homogeneity, the lack of societal and cultural diversity, but none of them had quite realised that among the Akans there  were no foreigners . There had never been any foreigners, until the ships from the Ekumen landed. \\n It was a simple fact, but one remarkably difficult for the Terran mind to comprehend. No aliens. No others, in the deadly sense of otherness that existed on Terra, the implacable division between tribes, the arbitrary and impassable borders, the ethnic hatreds cherished over centuries and millennia. ‘The people’ here meant not  my  people, but people—everybody, humanity. ‘Barbarian’ didn’t mean an incomprehensible outlander, but an uneducated person. On Aka, all competition was familial. All wars were civil wars. \\n One of the great epics Sutty was now recording in pieces and fragments concerned a long-running and bloody feud over a fertile valley, which began as a quarrel between a brother and sister over inheritance. Struggles between regions and city-states for economic dominance had gone on all through Akan history, flaring often into armed conflict. But these wars and feuds had been fought by professional soldiers, on battlefields. It was a very rare thing, and treated in the histories and annals as shamefully, punishably wrong, for soldiers to destroy cities or farmlands or to hurt civilians. Akans fought each other out of greed and ambition for power, not out of hatred and not in the name of a belief. They fought by the rules. They had the same rules. They were one people. Their system of thought and way of life had been universal. They had all sung one tune, though in many voices. \\n Much of this communality, Sutty thought, had depended on the writing. Before the Dovzan cultural revolution there had been several major languages and innumerable dialects, but they had all used the same ideograms, mutually intelligible to all. Clumsy and archaic as nonalphabetic scripts were in some respects, they could bond and preserve, as Chinese ideograms had done on Earth, a great diversity of languages and dialects; and they made texts written thousands of years ago readable without translation even though the sounds of the words had changed out of all recognition. Indeed, to the Dovzan reformers, that may have been the chief reason for getting rid of the old script: it was not only an impediment to progress but an actively conservative force. It kept the past alive. \\n In Dovza City she had met nobody who could, or who admitted they could, read the old writing. Her few early questions concerning it met with such disapproval and blank rejection that she promptly learned not to mention the fact that she could read it. And the officials dealing with her never asked. The old writing had not been used for decades; it probably never occurred to them that, through the accident of time lapse during space travel, it had been the writing she learned. \\n She had not been entirely foolish to wonder, there in Dovza City, if she might actually be the only person in the world who could now read it, and not entirely foolish to be frightened by the thought. If she carried the entire history of a people, not her own people, in her head, then if she forgot one word, one character, one diacritical mark, that much of all those lives, all those centuries of thought and feeling, would be lost forever… \\n It had been a vast relief to her to find, here in Okzat-Ozkat, many people, old and young, even children, carrying and sharing that precious cargo. Most could read and write a few dozen characters, or a few hundred, and many went on to full literacy. In the Corporation schools, children learned the Hainish-derived alphabet and were educated as producer-consumers; at home or in illicit classes in little rooms behind a shop, a workshop, a warehouse, they learned the ideograms. They practiced writing the characters on small blackboards that could be wiped clean with a stroke. Their teachers were working people, householders, shopkeepers, common people of the city. \\n These teachers of the old language and the old way, the ‘educated people,’ were called maz. Yoz was a term indicating respectful equality; maz as an address indicated increased respect. As a title or a noun, it meant, as Sutty began to understand it, a function or profession that wasn’t definable as priest, teacher, doctor, or scholar, but contained aspects of them all. \\n All the maz Sutty met, and as the weeks went on she met most of the maz in Okzat-Ozkat, lived in more or less comfortable poverty. Usually they had a trade or job to supplement what they were paid as maz for teaching, dispensing medicine and counsel on diet and health, performing certain ceremonies such as marriage and burial, and reading and talking in the evening meetings, the tellings. The maz were poor, not because the old way was dying or was treasured only by the old, but because the people who paid them were poor. This was a hard-bitten little city, marginal, without wealth. But the people supported their maz, paid for their teaching “by the word,” as they said. They came to the house of one maz or another in the evening to listen to the stories and the discussions, paying regular fees in copper money, small paper bills. There was no shame in the transaction on either side, no hypocrisy of ‘donation’: cash was paid for value received. \\n Many children were brought along in the evening to the tellings, to which they listened, more or less, or fell quietly asleep. No fee was charged for children until they were fifteen or so, when they began to pay the same fees as adults. Adolescents favored the sessions of certain maz who specialised in reciting or reading epics and romances, such as  The Valley War  and the tales of Ezid the Beautiful. Exercise classes of the more vigorous and martial kind were full of young men and women. \\n The maz, however, were mostly middle-aged or old, again not because they were dying out as a group, but because, as they said, it took a lifetime to learn how to walk in the forest. \\n Sutty wanted to find out why the task of becoming educated was interminable; but the task of finding out seemed to be interminable itself. What was it these people believed? What was it they held sacred? She kept looking for the core of the matter, the words at the heart of the Telling, the holy books to study and memorise. She found them, but not it. No bible. No koran. Dozens of upanishads, a million sutras. Every maz gave her something else to read. Already she had read or heard countless texts, written, oral, both written and oral, many or most of them existing in more than one mode and more than one version. The subject matter of the tellings seemed to be endless, even now, when so much had been destroyed. \\n Early in the winter she thought she had found the central texts of the system in a series of poems and treatises called  The Arbor . All the maz spoke of it with great respect, all of them quoted from it. She spent weeks studying it. As well as she could determine, it had mostly been written between fifteen hundred and a thousand years ago in the central region of the continent during a period of material prosperity and artistic and intellectual ferment. It was a vast compendium of sophisticated philosophical reasonings on being and becoming, form and chaos, mystical meditations on the Making and the Made, and beautiful, difficult, metaphysical poems concerning the One that is Two, the Two that are One, all interconnected, illuminated, and complicated by the commentaries and marginalia of all the centuries since. Uncle Hurree’s niece, the scholar-pedant, rushed exulting into that jungle of significances, willing to be lost there for years. She was brought back to daylight only by her conscience, which trailed along carrying the heavy baggage of common sense, nagging: But this isn’t the Telling, this is just a part of it, just a  small  part of it… \\n Conscience finally got decisive help in its task from Maz Oryen Viya, who mentioned that the text of  The Arbor  that Sutty had been coming to study at his house every day for a month was only a portion of, and in many places entirely different from, a text he had seen many years ago in a great umyazu in Amareza. \\n There was no correct text. There was no standard version. Of anything. There was not one  Arbor  but many, many arbors. The jungle was endless, and it was not one jungle but endless jungles, all burning with bright tigers of meaning, endless tigers… \\n Sutty finished scanning Oryen Viya’s version of  The Arbor  into her noter, put the crystal away, knocked her inner pedant on the head, and started all over. \\n Whatever it was she was trying to learn, the education she was trying to get, was not a religion with a creed and a sacred book. It did not deal in belief. All its books were sacred. It could not be defined by symbols and ideas, no matter how beautiful, rich, and interesting its symbols and ideas. And it was not called the Forest, though sometimes it was, or the Mountain, though sometimes it was, but was mostly, as far as she could see, called the Telling. Why? \\n Well (said common sense, rudely), because what the educated people  do  all the time is tell stories. \\n Yes, of course (her intellect replied with some disdain) they tell parables, stories, that’s how they  educate . But what do they  do? \\n She set out to observe the maz. \\n Back on Terra, when she first studied the languages of Aka, she had learned that all the major ones had a peculiar singular/dual pronoun, used for a pregnant woman or animal and for a married couple. She had met it again in  The Arbor  and many other texts, where it referred to the single/double trunk of the tree of being and also to the mythic-heroic figures of the stories and epics, who usually—like the producer-consumer heroes of Corporation propaganda—came in pairs. This pronoun had been banned by the Corporation. Use of it in speech or writing was punishable by fine. She had never heard it spoken in Dovza City. But here she heard it daily, though not publicly, spoken of and to the teacher-officiants, the maz. Why? \\n Because the maz were couples. They were always couples. A sexual partnership, heterosexual or homosexual, monogamous, lifelong. More than lifelong, for if widowed they never remarried. They took and kept each other’s name. The Fertiliser’s wife, Ang Sotyu, had been dead fifteen years, but he was still Sotyu Ang. They were two who were one, one who was two. \\n Why? \\n She got excited. She was on the track of the central principle of the system: it was the Two that are One. She must concentrate upon understanding it. \\n Obliging maz gave her many texts, all more or less relevant. She learned that from the interplay of the Two arise the triple Branches that join to make the Foliages, consisting of the Four Actions and the Five Elements, to which the cosmology and the medical and ethical systems constantly referred, and which were built into the architecture and were structural to the language, particularly in its ideogrammatic form…She realised that she was getting into another jungle, a very ancient one, an appallingly exuberant one. She stood on the outskirts and peered in, yearning but cautious, with conscience whining behind her like a dog. Good dog, dharma dog. She did not go into that jungle. \\n She remembered that she had intended to find what it was that the maz actually did. \\n They performed, or enacted, or did, the Telling. They told. \\n Some people had only a little to tell. They owned a book or poem or map or treatise that they had inherited or been given, and that, at least once a year, generally in the winter, they displayed or read aloud or recited from memory to anybody who wanted to come. Such people were politely called educated people, and were respected for owning and sharing their treasure, but they were not maz. \\n The maz were professionals. They gave a major part of their life to acquiring and sharing what they told, and made their living by doing so. \\n Some of them, specialists in ceremonies, resembled the priests of conventional Terran religions, officiating at the rites of passage, marriages, funerals, welcoming the newborn into the community, celebrating the fifteenth birthday, which was considered an important and fortunate occasion (One plus Two plus Three plus Four plus Five). The tellings of such maz were mostly formulaic—chants and rituals and recitations of the most familiar hero tales. \\n Some maz were physicians, healers, herbalists, or botanists. Like the leaders of exercise and gymnastic arts, they told the body, and also listened to the body (the body that was the Tree, that was the Mountain). Their tellings were factual, descriptive, medical teachings. \\n Some maz worked mostly with books: they taught children and adults to write and read the ideograms, they taught the texts and ways of understanding them. \\n But the essential work of the maz, what gave them honor among the people, was telling: reading aloud, reciting, telling stories, and talking about the stories. The more they told, the more they were honored, and the better they told it, the better they were paid. What they talked about depended on what they knew, what they possessed of the lore, what they invented on their own, and, evidently, what they felt like talking about at the moment. \\n The incoherence of it all was staggering. During the weeks that Sutty had laboriously learned about the Two and the One, the Tree and the Foliage, she had gone every evening to hear Maz Ottiar Uming tell a long mythico-historical saga about the explorations of the Rumay among the Eastern Isles six or seven thousand years ago, and also gone several mornings a week to hear Maz Imyen Katyan tell the origins and history of the cosmos, name the stars and constellations, and describe the movements of the other four planets in the Akan system, while displaying beautiful, accurate, ancient charts of the sky. How did it all hang together? Was there any relation at all among these disparate things? \\n Fed up with the abstractions of philosophy, for which she had little gift and less inclination, Sutty turned to what the maz called body-telling. The healer maz seemed to know a good deal about maintaining health. She asked Sotyu Ang to teach her about medicine. He patiently began to tell her the curative properties of each of the items in the immense herbary he had inherited from Ang Sotyu’s parents, which filled most of the little drawers in his shop. \\n He was very pleased that she was recording all he told her in her noter. So far she had met no arcane wisdoms in the Telling, no holy secrets that could be told only to adepts, no knowledge withheld to fortify the authority of the learned, magnify their sanctity, or increase their fees. “Write down what I tell you!” all the maz kept saying. “Memorise it! Keep it to tell other people!” Sotyu Ang had spent his adult life learning the properties of the herbs, and having no disciple or apprentice, he was touchingly grateful to Sutty for preserving that knowledge. “It is all I have to give the Telling,” he said. He was not a healer himself but an apothecary and herbalist. He wasn’t strong on theory; his explanations of why this or that herb worked were often mere associative magic or went in pure verbal circles: this bark dispels fever because it is a febrifuge…But the system of medicine that underlay this pharmaceutics was, as well as she could judge, pragmatic, preventive, and effective. \\n Pharmacy and medicine were one of the branches of the Great System. There were many, many branches. The endless story-telling of the maz was about many, many things. All things, all the leaves of the immense foliage of the Tree. She could not give up the conviction that there must be some guiding motive, some central concern. The trunk of the Tree. Was it ethics? the right conduct of life? \\n Having grown up under Unism, she was not so naive as to think there was any necessary relation between religion and morality, or that if there was a relation it was likely to be a benevolent one. \\n But she had begun to discern and learn a characteristic Akan ethic, expressed in all the parables and moral tales she heard in the tellings, and in the behavior and conversation of the people she knew in Okzat-Ozkat. Like the medicine, the ethic was pragmatic and preventive, and seemed to be pretty effective. It chiefly prescribed respect for your own and everybody else’s body, and chiefly proscribed usury. \\n The frequency with which excess profit making was denounced in the stories and in public opinion showed that the root of all evil went deep on Aka. In Okzat-Ozkat, crime consisted mostly of theft, cheating, embezzlement. There was little personal violence. Assault and battery, perpetrated by thieves or by enraged victims of theft or extortion getting revenge, was so rare that every case of it was discussed for days or weeks. Crimes of passion were even rarer. They were not glamorised or condoned. In the tales and histories, heroism was not earned by murder or slaughter. Heroes were those who atoned for violent acts, or those who died bravely. The word for murderer was a cognate of the word for madman. Iziezi couldn’t tell Sutty whether murderers were locked up in a jail or in a madhouse, because she didn’t know of any murderers in Okzat-Ozkat. She had heard that in the old days rapists had been castrated, but wasn’t sure how rape was punished now, because she didn’t know of any cases of it either. Akans were gentle with their children, and Iziezi seemed to find the idea of mistreating children almost inconceivable; she knew some folktales of cruel parents, of children left orphaned who starved because nobody took them in, but she said, “Those stories are from long ago, before people were educated.” \\n The Corporation, of course, had introduced a new ethic, with new virtues such as public spirit and patriotism, and a vast new area of crime: participation in banned activities. But Sutty had yet to meet anybody in Okzat-Ozkat, outside Corporation officials and perhaps some of the students at the Teachers’ College, who thought of the maz or anything they did as criminal. Banned, illicit, illegal, deviant: these new categories redefined behavior, but they were without moral meaning except to their authors. \\n Had there been no crimes, then, in the old days, but rape, murder, and usury? \\n Maybe there had been no need for further sanctions. Maybe the system had been so universal that nobody could imagine living outside it, and only self-destructive insanity could subvert it. It had been the way of life. It had been the world. \\n That ubiquity of the system, its great antiquity, the tremendous force of habit it had acquired through its detailed patterning of daily life, food, drink, hours and aims of work and recreation—all this, Sutty told her noter, might explain modern Aka. At least it might explain how the Corporation of Dovza had achieved hegemony so easily, had been able to enforce uniform, minute control over how people lived, what they ate, drank, read, heard, thought, did. The system had been in place. Anciently, massively in place, all over the Continent and Isles of Aka. All Dovza had done was take the system over and change its goals. From a great consensual social pattern within which each individual sought physical and spiritual satisfaction, they had made it a great hierarchy in which each individual served the indefinite growth of the society’s material wealth and complexity. From an active homeostatic balance they had turned it to an active forward-thrusting imbalance. \\n The difference, Sutty told her noter, was between somebody sitting thinking after a good meal and somebody running furiously to catch the bus. \\n She was pleased with that image. \\n She looked back on her first half year on Aka with incredulity and with pity both for herself and for the consumer-producers of Dovza City. “What sacrifices these people have made!” she told her noter. “They agreed to deny their entire culture and impoverish their lives for the ‘March to the Stars’—an artificial, theoretical goal—an imitation of societies they assumed to be superior merely because they were capable of space flight. Why? There’s a step missing. Something happened to cause or catalyse this enormous change. Was it nothing more than the arrival of the First Observers from the Ekumen? Of course that was an enormous event for a people who’d never known outsiders…” \\n An enormous burden of responsibility on the outsiders, too, she thought. \\n “Do not betray us!” the Monitor had said. But her people, the starfarers of the Ekumen, the Observers who were so careful not to intervene, not to interfere, not to take control, had brought betrayal with them. A few Spaniards arrive, and the great empires of the Incas, the Aztecs, betray themselves, collapse, let their gods and their very language be denied…So the Akans had been their own conquerors. Bewildered by foreign concepts, by the very concept of foreignness, they had let the ideologues of Dovza dominate and impoverish them. As the ideologues of Communocapitalism in the twentieth century, and the zealots of Unism in her own century, had dominated and impoverished the Earth. \\n If indeed this process had begun with first contact, perhaps it was by way of reparation that Tong Ov wanted to learn what could be learned of Aka before the First Observers came. Did he have some hope of eventually restoring to the Akans what they had thrown away? But the Corporation State would never allow it. “Look in the garbage for the gold piece,” was a saying she had learned from Maz Ottiar Uming, but she didn’t think the Monitor would agree with it. To him the gold piece was a rotten corpse. \\n She had mental conversations with the Monitor quite often during that long winter of learning and listening, reading and practicing, thinking and rethinking. She set him up as her boxing dummy. He didn’t get to answer, only to listen to her. There were things she didn’t want to record in her noter, things she thought in the privacy of her head, opinions that she couldn’t cease to cherish but tried to keep separate from observation. Such as her opinion that if the Telling was a religion it was very different from Terran religions, since it entirely lacked dogmatic belief, emotional frenzy, deferral of reward to a future life, and sanctioned bigotry. All those elements, which the Akans had done so well without, she thought, had been introduced by Dovza. It was the Corporation State that was the religion. And so she liked to summon up the blue-and-tan uniform, the stiff back and cold face of the Monitor, and tell him what a zealot he was, and what a fool, along with all the other bureaucrat-ideologues, for grasping after other people’s worthless goods while tossing his own treasure into the garbage. \\n The actual flesh-and-blood Monitor must have left Okzat-Ozkat; she had not met him in the streets for weeks. It was a relief. She much preferred him as a minatory figment. \\n She had stopped posing the question about what the maz did. Any four-year-old could have said what they did. They told. They retold, read, recited, discussed, explained, and invented. The infinite matter of their talk was not fixed and could not be defined. And it was still growing, even now; for not all the texts were learned from others, not all the stories were of ancient days, not all the thoughts and ideas had been handed down over the years. \\n The first time she met the maz Odiedin Manma was at a telling where he told the story of a young man, a villager up in the foothills of Silong, who dreamed that he could fly. The young man dreamed flying so often and so vividly that it seemed he began to take his dreams for waking life. He would describe the sensations of flight and the things he saw from the air. He drew maps of beautiful unknown lands on the other side of the world that he discovered in his flights. People came to hear him tell about flying and to see the marvelous maps. But one day, climbing down a river gorge after a strayed eberdin, he missed his footing, fell, and was killed. \\n That was all the story. Odiedin Manma made no comment, and no one asked questions. The telling was at the house of the maz Ottiar and Uming. Sutty later asked Maz Ottiar Uming about the story, for it puzzled her. \\n The old woman said, “Odiedin’s partner Manma was killed in a fall when he was twenty-seven. They had been maz only a year.” \\n “And Manma used to tell his dreams of flying?” \\n Ottiar Uming shook her head. “No,” she said. “That is the story, yoz. Odiedin Manma’s story. He tells that one. The rest of his telling is in the body.” She meant exercises, gymnastic practice, of which Odiedin was a highly respected teacher. \\n “I see,” Sutty said, and went away and thought about it. \\n She knew one thing, she had learned one thing for sure, here in Okzat-Ozkat: she had learned how to listen. To listen, hear, keep listening to what she’d heard. To carry the words away and listen to them. If telling was the skill of the maz, listening was the skill of the yoz. As they all liked to remark, neither one was any use without the other. \\n ',\n",
       " 'FIVE \\n WINTER CAME WITHOUT  much snow but bitterly cold, winds knifing down out of the immense wilderness of mountains to the west and north. Iziezi took Sutty to a secondhand clothing store to buy a worn but sturdy leather coat lined with its own silky fleece. The hood lining was the feathery fur of some mountain animal of which Iziezi said, “All gone now. Too many hunters.” She said the leather was not eberdin, as Sutty had thought, but minule, from the high mountains. The coat came below her knees and was met by light, fleece-lined boots. These were new, made of artificial materials, for mountain sports and hiking. The people of the old way placidly accepted new technologies and products, so long as they worked better than the old ones and so long as using them did not require changing one’s life in any important way. To Sutty this seemed a profound but reasonable conservatism. But to an economy predicated on endless growth, it was anathema. \\n Sutty tramped around the icy streets in her old coat and her new boots. In winter in Okzat-Ozkat everybody looked alike in their old leather coats and fleecy hoods, except for the uniformed bureaucrats, who all looked alike in their coats and hoods of artificial fabrics in bright uniform colors, purple, rust, and blue. The merciless cold gave a kind of fellowship of anonymity. When you got indoors the warmth was an unfailing source of relief, pleasure, companionly feeling. On a bitter blue evening, to struggle up the steep streets to some small, stuffy, dim-lit room and gather with the others at the hearth—an electric heater, for there was little wood here near timberline, and all warmth was generated by the ice-cold energy of the Ereha—and to take your mittens off and rub your hands, which seemed so naked and delicate, and look round at the other windburned faces and ice-dewed eyelashes, and hear the little drum go tabatt, tabatt, and the soft voice begin to speak, listing the names of the rivers of Hoying and how each flowed into the next, or telling the story of Ezid and Inamema on the Mountain of Gam, or describing how the Council of Mez raised an army against the western barbarians—that was a solid, enduring, reliable pleasure to Sutty, all winter long. \\n The western barbarians, she now knew, were the Dovzans. Almost everything the maz taught, all their legends and history and philosophy, came from the center and east of the great continent, and from past centuries, past millennia. Nothing came from Dovza but the language they spoke; and here that was full of words from the original language of this area, Rangma, and other tongues. \\n Words. A world made of words. \\n There was music. Some of the maz sang healing chants like those Tong Ov had recorded in the city; some played string instruments, plucked or bowed, to accompany narrative ballads and songs. Sutty recorded them when she could, though her musical stupidity kept her from appreciating them. There had been art, carvings and paintings and tapestries, using the symbols of the Tree and the Mountain and figures and events from the legends and histories. There had been dance, and there were still the various forms of exercise and moving meditation. But first and last there were the words. \\n When the maz put the mantle of their office—a flimsy length of red or blue cloth—over their shoulders, they were perceived as owning a sacred authority or power. What they said then was part of the Telling. \\n When they took the scarf off they returned to ordinary status, claiming no personal spiritual authority at all; what they said then weighed no more than what anybody said. Some people of course insisted on ascribing permanent authority to them. Like the people of Sutty’s own tribe, many Akans longed to follow a leader, turn earned payment into tribute, load responsibility onto somebody else’s shoulders. But if the maz had one quality in common, it was a stubborn modesty. They were not in the charisma business. Maz Imyen Katyan was as gentle a man as she had ever met, but when a woman called him by a reverent title, munan, used for famous maz in the stories and histories, he turned on her with real rage—“How dare you call me that?”—and then, having regained his calm, “When I’ve been dead a hundred years, yoz.” \\n Sutty had assumed that since everything the maz did professionally was in defiance of the law, at real personal risk, some of this modest style, this very low profile, was a recent thing. But when she said so, Maz Ottiar Uming shook her head. \\n “Oh, no,” the old woman said. “We have to hide, to keep everything secret, yes. But in my grandparents’ time I think most of the maz lived the way we do. Nobody can wear the scarf all the time! Not even Maz Elyed Oni…Of course it was different in the umyazu.” \\n “Tell me about the umyazu, maz.” \\n “They were places built so the power could gather in them. Places full of being. Full of people telling and listening. Full of books.” \\n “Where were they?” \\n “Oh, everywhere. Here in Okzat-Ozkat there was one up where the High School is now, and one where the pumice works is now. And all the way to Silong, in the high valleys, on the trade roads, there were umyazu for the pilgrims. And down where the land’s rich, there were huge, great umyazu, with hundreds of maz living in them, and visiting from one to another all their lives. They kept books, and wrote them, and made records, and kept on telling. They could give their whole life to it, you see. They could always be there where it was. People would go visit them to hear the telling and read the books in the libraries. People went in processions, with red and blue flags. They’d go and stay all winter, sometimes. Save up for years so they could pay the maz and pay for their lodging. My grandmother told me about going to the Red Umyazu of Tenban. She was eleven or twelve years old. It took them nearly the whole year to go and stay and come back. They were pretty wealthy, my grandmother’s family, so they could ride all the way, the whole family, with eberdin pulling the wagon. They didn’t have the cars and planes then, you know. Nobody did. Most people just walked. But everybody had flags and wore ribbons. Red and blue.” Ottiar Uming laughed with pleasure at the thought of those processions. “My mother’s mother wrote the story of that journey. I’ll get it out and tell it sometime.” \\n Her partner, Uming Ottiar, was unfolding a big, stiff square of paper on the table in the back room of their grocery shop. Ottiar Uming went to help him, setting a polished black stone on each curling corner to keep it flat. Then they invited their five listeners to come forward, salute the paper with the mountain-heart gesture, and study the chart and inscriptions on it. They displayed it thus every three weeks, and Sutty had come each time all winter. It had been her first formal introduction to the thought system of the Tree. The couple’s most precious possession, given them fifty years ago by their teacher-maz, it was a marvelously painted map or mandala of the One that is Two giving rise to the Three, to the Five, to the Myriad, and the Myriad again to the Five, the Three, the Two, the One…A Tree, a Body, a Mountain, inscribed within the circle that was everything and nothing. Delicate little figures, animals, people, plants, rocks, rivers, lively as flickering flames, made up each of the greater forms, which divided, rejoined, transformed each into the others and into the whole, the unity made up of infinite variety, the mystery plain as day. \\n Sutty loved to study it and try to make out the inscriptions and poems surrounding it. The painting was beautiful, the poetry was splendid and elusive, the whole chart was a work of high art, absorbing, enlightening. Maz Uming sat down and after a few knocks on his drum began intoning one of the interminable chants that accompanied the rituals and many of the tellings. Maz Ottiar read and discussed some of the inscriptions, which were four or five hundred years old. Her voice was soft, full of silences. Softly and hesitantly, the students asked questions. She answered them the same way. \\n Then she drew back and sat down and took up the chant in a gnat voice, and old Uming, half blind, his speech thickened by a stroke, got up and talked about one of the poems. \\n “That’s by Maz Niniu Raying, five, six, seven hundred years back, eh? It’s in  The Arbor . Somebody wrote it here, a good calligrapher, because it talks about how the leaves of the Tree perish but always return so long as we see them and say them. See, here it says: ‘Word, the gold beyond the fall, returns the glory to the branch.’ And underneath it here, see, somebody later on wrote, ‘Mind’s life is memory.’” He smiled round at them, a kind, lopsided smile. “Remember that, eh? ‘Mind’s life is memory.’ Don’t forget!” He laughed, they laughed. All the while, out front in the grocery shop, the maz’ grandson kept the volume turned up high on the audio system, cheery music, exhortations, and news announcements blaring out to cover the illicit poetry, the forbidden laughter. \\n It was a pity, but no surprise, Sutty told her noter, that an ancient popular cosmology-philosophy-spiritual discipline should contain a large proportion of superstition and verge over into what she labeled in her noter HP, hocus-pocus. The great jungle of significance had its swamps and morasses, and she had at last stumbled into some of them. She met a few maz who claimed arcane knowledge and supernal powers. Boring as she found all such claims, she knew she could not be sure of what was valuable and what was drivel, and painstakingly recorded whatever information she could buy from these maz concerning alchemy, numerology, and literal readings of symbolic texts. They sold her bits of texts and snippets of methodology at a fairly stiff price, grudgingly, hedging the transactions with portentous warnings about the danger of this powerful knowledge. \\n She particularly detested the literal readings. By such literalism, fundamentalism, religions betrayed the best intentions of their founders. Reducing thought to formula, replacing choice by obedience, these preachers turned the living word into dead law. But she put it all into her noter—which she had now had to unload into crystal storage twice, for she could not transmit any of the treasure-and-trash she was amassing. \\n At this distance, with all means of communication monitored, there was no way to consult with Tong Ov as to what she should or he intended to do with all this material. She couldn’t even tell him she’d found it. The problem remained, and grew. \\n Among the HP she came on a brand that was, as far as she knew, unique to Aka: a system of arcane significances attached to the various strokes that composed the ideogrammatic characters and the further strokes and dots that qualified them with verbal tense and mode and nominal case and with Action or Element (for everything, literally every thing, could be categorised under the Four Actions and the Five Elements). Every character of the old writing thus became a code to be interpreted by specialists, who functioned much as horoscope readers had in Sutty’s homeland. She discovered that many people in Okzat-Ozkat, including officials of the Corporation, would undertake nothing of importance without calling in a ‘sign reader’ to write out their name and other relevant words and, after poring over these and referring to impressively elaborate charts and diagrams, to advise and foretell. “This is the kind of thing that makes me sympathise with the Monitor,” she told her noter. Then she said, “No. It’s what the Monitor wants from his own kind of HP. Political HP. Everything locked in place, on course, under control. But he’s handed over the controls just as much as they have.” \\n Many of the practices she learned about had equivalents on Earth. The exercises, like yoga and tai chi, were physical-mental, a lifelong discipline, leading toward mindfulness, or toward a trance state, or toward martial vigor and readiness, depending on the style and the practitioner’s desire. Trance seemed to be sought for its own sake as an experience of essential stillness and balance rather than as satori or revelation. Prayer…Well, what about prayer? \\n The Akans did not pray. \\n That seemed so strange, so unnatural, that as soon as she had the thought, she qualified it: it was very possible that she didn’t properly understand what prayer was. \\n If it meant asking for something, they didn’t do it. Not even to the extent that she did. She knew that when she was very startled she cried, “O Ram!” and when she was very frightened she whispered, “O please, please.” The words were strictly meaningless, yet she knew they were a kind of prayer. She had never heard an Akan say anything of the kind. They could wish one another well—“May you have a good year, may your venture prosper”—just as they could curse one another—“May your sons eat stones,” she had heard Diodi the barrow man murmur as a blue-and-tan stalked by. But those were wishes, not prayers. People didn’t ask God to make them good or to destroy their enemy. They didn’t ask the gods to win them the lottery or cure their sick child. They didn’t ask the clouds to let the rain fall or the grain grow. They wished, they willed, they hoped, but they didn’t pray. \\n If prayer was praise, then perhaps they did pray. She had come to understand their descriptions of natural phenomena, the Fertiliser’s pharmacopoeia, the maps of the stars, the lists of ores and minerals, as litanies of praise. By naming the names they rejoiced in the complexity and specificity, the wealth and beauty of the world, they participated in the fullness of being. They described, they named, they told all about everything. But they did not pray for anything. \\n Nor did they sacrifice anything. Except money. \\n To get money, you had to give money: that was a firm and universal principle. Before any business undertaking, they buried silver and brass coins, or threw them into the river, or gave them to beggars. They pounded out gold coins into airy, translucent gold leaf with which they decorated niches, columns, even whole walls of buildings, or had them spun into thread and woven into gorgeous shawls and scarves to give away on New Year’s Day. Silver and gold coins were hard to come by, as the Corporation, detesting this extravagant waste, had gone over mostly to paper; so people burned paper money like incense, made paper boats of it and sailed them off on the river, chopped it up fine and ate it with salad. The practice was pure HP, but Sutty found it irresistible. Slaughtering goats or one’s firstborn to placate the supernatural seemed to her the worst kind of perversity, but she saw a gambler’s gallantry in this money sacrifice. Easy come, easy go. At the New Year, when you met a friend or acquaintance, you each lighted a one-ha bill and waved it about like a little torch, wishing each other health and prosperity. She saw even employees of the Corporation doing this. She wondered if the Monitor had ever done it. \\n The more naive people that she came to know at the tellings and in the classes, and Diodi and other friendly acquaintances of the streets, all believed in sign reading and alchemical marvels and talked about diets that let you live forever, exercises that had given the ancient heroes the strength to withstand whole armies. Even Iziezi held firmly by sign reading. But most of the maz, the educated, the teachers, claimed no special powers or attainments at all. They lived firmly and wholly in the real world. Spiritual yearning and the sense of sacredness they knew, but they did not know anything holier than the world, they did not seek a power greater than nature. Sutty was certain of that.  No miracles!  she told her noter, jubilant. \\n She coded her notes, got into her coat and boots, and set off through the vicious early-spring wind for Maz Odiedin Manma’s exercise class. Silong was visible for the first time in weeks, not the barrier wall but only the peak above it, standing like a silver horn over dark storm clouds. \\n She went regularly to exercise with Iziezi now, often staying on to watch Akidan and other adolescents and young people do “two-one,” an athletic form performed in pairs, with spectacular feints and falls. Odiedin Manma, the teller of the strange story about the man who dreamed he could fly, was much admired by these young people, and some of them had first taken Sutty to his class. He taught an austere, very beautiful form of exercise-meditation. He had invited her to join his group. \\n They met in an old warehouse down by the river, a less safe place than the umyazu-turned-gymnasium she went to with Iziezi, where legitimate health-manual gymnastics did take place and served as cover for the illegal ones. The warehouse was lighted only by dirty slit windows high up under the eaves. Nobody spoke above the barest whisper. There was no hocus-pocus about Odiedin, but Sutty found the class, the silent, slow movements in darkness, hauntingly strange, sometimes disturbing; it had entered into her dreams. \\n A man sitting near Sutty this morning stared at her as she took her place on the mat. While the group went through the first part of the form, he kept staring, winking, gesturing, grinning at her. Nobody behaved like that. She was annoyed and embarrassed until, during a long-held pose, she got a look at the man and realised that he was half-witted. \\n When the group began a set of movements she wasn’t yet familiar with, she watched and followed along as best she could. Her mistakes and omissions upset her neighbor. He kept trying to show her when and how to move, pantomiming, exaggerating gestures. When they stood up, she stayed sitting, which was always permissible, but this distressed the poor fellow very much. He gestured, Up! up! He mouthed the word, and pointed upward. Finally, whispering, “Up—like this—see?,” he took a step onto the air. He brought the other foot up on the invisible stair, and then climbed another step up the same way. He was standing barefoot half a meter above the floor, looking down at her, smiling anxiously and gesturing for her to join him. He was standing on the air. \\n Odiedin, a lithe, trim man of fifty with a scrap of blue cloth around his neck, came to him. All the others kept on steadily with the complex, swaying kelp-forest patterns. Odiedin murmured, “Come down, Uki.” Reaching up, he took the man’s hand and led him down two nonexistent steps to the floor, patted his shoulder gently, and moved on. Uki joined in the pattern, swaying and turning with flawless grace and power. He had evidently forgotten Sutty. \\n She could not bring herself to ask Odiedin any questions after the class. What would she ask? “Did you see what I saw? Did I?” That would be stupid. It couldn’t have happened, and so he’d no doubt merely answer her question with a question. \\n Or perhaps the reason she didn’t ask was that she was afraid he would simply answer, “Yes.” \\n If a mime can make air into a box, if a fakir can climb a rope tied to air, maybe a poor fool can make air into a step. If spiritual strength can move mountains, maybe it can make stairs. Trance state. Hypnotic or hypnogogic suggestion. \\n She described the occurrence briefly in her daily notes, without comment. As she spoke into her noter, she became quite sure that there had in fact been some kind of step there that she hadn’t seen in the dim light, a block, a box perhaps, painted black. Of course there had been something there. She paused, but did not say anything more. She could see the block or box, now. But she had not seen it. \\n But often in her mind’s eye she saw those two callused, muscular, bare feet stepping up the absent mountain. She wondered what the air felt like on the soles of your feet when you walked on it. Cool? Resilient? \\n After that she made herself pay more attention to the old texts and tales that talked about walking on the wind, riding on clouds, traveling to the stars, destroying distant enemies with thunderbolts. Such feats were always ascribed to heroes and wise maz far away and long ago, even though a good many of them had been made commonplace fact by modern technologies. She still thought they were mythic, metaphoric, not meant to be taken literally. She arrived at no explanation. \\n But her attitude had been changed. She knew now that she’d still missed the point, a misunderstanding so gross and total that she couldn’t see it. \\n A telling is not an explaining. \\n Can’t see the forest for the trees, the pedants, the pundits,  Uncle Hurree growled in her mind.  Poetry, girl, poetry. Read the Mahabharata. Everything’s there. \\n “Maz Elyed,” she asked, “what is it you do?” \\n “I tell, yoz Sutty.” \\n “Yes. But the stories, all the things you tell, what do they do?” \\n “They tell the world.” \\n “Why, maz?” \\n “That’s what people do, yoz. What we’re here for.” \\n Maz Elyed, like many of the maz, talked softly and rather hesitantly, pausing, starting up again about the time you thought she’d stopped. Silence was part of all she said. \\n She was small, lame, and very wrinkled. Her family owned a little hardware shop in the poorest district of the city, where many houses were not built of stone and wood but were tents or yurts of felt and canvas patched with plastic, set on platforms of beaten clay. Nephews and grandnieces abounded in the hardware shop. A very small great-grandnephew staggered about it, his goal in life to eat screws and washers. An old 2D photograph of Elyed with her partner Oni hung on the wall behind the counter: Oni Elyed tall and dreamy-eyed, Elyed Oni tiny, vivid, beautiful. Thirty years ago they had been arrested for sexual deviance and teaching rotten-corpse ideology. They were sent to a re-education camp on the west coast. Oni had died there. Elyed came back after ten years, lame, with no teeth: knocked out or lost to scurvy, she never said. She did not talk about herself or her wife or her age or her concerns. Her days were spent in an unbroken ritual continuity that included all bodily needs and functions, preparing and eating meals, sleeping, teaching, but above all reading and telling, a soft, endless repetition of the texts she had been learning her whole life long. \\n At first Elyed had appeared unearthly, inhuman to Sutty, as indifferent and inaccessible as a cloud, a domestic saint living entirely inside the ritual system, a sort of automaton of recitation without emotion or personality. Sutty had feared her. She was afraid that this woman who embodied the system fully, who lived it totally, would force her to admit that it was hysterical, obsessional, absolutist, everything she hated and feared and wanted it not to be. But as she listened to Elyed’s tellings, she heard a disciplined, reasoning mind, though it spoke of what was unreasonable. \\n Elyed used that word often, unreasonable, in a literal sense: what cannot be understood by thinking. Once when Sutty was trying to find a coherent line of thought connecting several different tellings, Elyed said, “What we do is unreasonable, yoz.” \\n “But there is a reason  for  it.” \\n “Probably.” \\n “What I don’t understand is the pattern. The place, the importance of things in the pattern. Yesterday you were telling the story about Iaman and Deberren, but you didn’t finish it, and today you read the descriptions of the leaves of the trees of the grove at the Golden Mountain. I don’t understand what they have to do with each other. Or is it that on certain days a certain kind of material is proper? Or are my questions just stupid?” \\n “No,” the maz said, and laughed her small laugh that had no teeth to show. “I get tired remembering. So I read. It doesn’t matter. It’s all the leaves of the tree.” \\n “So…anything—anything that’s in the books is equally important?” \\n Elyed considered. “No,” she said. “Yes.” She drew a shaky breath. She tired quickly when she could not rest in the stream of ritual act and language, but she never dismissed Sutty, never evaded her questions. “It’s all we have. You see? It’s the way we have the world. Without the telling, we don’t have anything at all. The moment goes by like the water of the river. We’d tumble and spin and be helpless if we tried to live in the moment. We’d be like a baby. A baby can do it, but we’d drown. Our minds need to tell, need the telling. To hold. The past has passed, and there’s nothing in the future to catch hold of. The future is nothing yet. How could anybody live there? So what we have is the words that tell what happened and what happens. What was and is.” \\n “Memory?” Sutty said. “History?” \\n Elyed nodded, dubious, not satisfied by these terms. She sat thinking for some time and finally said, “We’re not outside the world, yoz. You know? We are the world. We’re its language. So we live and it lives. You see? If we don’t say the words, what is there in our world?” \\n She was trembling, little spasms of the hands and mouth that she tried to conceal. Sutty thanked her with the mountain-heart gesture, apologised for wearing her out with talk. Elyed gave her small, black laugh. “Oh, yoz, I keep going with talk. Just the way the world does,” she said. \\n Sutty went away and brooded. All this about language. It always came back to words. Like the Greeks with their Logos, the Hebrew Word that was God. But this was words. Not the Logos, the Word, but words. Not one but many, many…Nobody made the world, ruled the world, told the world to be. It was. It did. And human beings made it be, made it be a human world, by saying it? By telling what was in it and what happened in it? Anything, everything—tales of heroes, maps of the stars, love songs, lists of the shapes of leaves…For a moment she thought she understood. \\n She brought this half-formed understanding to Maz Ottiar Uming, who was easier to talk with than Elyed, wanting to try to put it into words. But Ottiar was busy with a chant, so Sutty talked to Uming, and somehow her words got contorted and pedantic. She couldn’t speak her intuition. \\n As they struggled to understand each other, Uming Ottiar showed a bitterness, almost the first Sutty had met with among these soft-voiced teachers. Despite his impediment he was a fluent talker, and he got going, mildly enough at first: “Animals have no language. They have their nature. You see? They know the way, they know where to go and how to go, following their nature. But we’re animals with no nature. Eh? Animals with no nature! That’s strange! We’re so strange! We have to talk about how to go and what to do, think about it, study it, learn it. Eh? We’re born to be reasonable, so we’re born ignorant. You see? If nobody teaches us the words, the thoughts, we stay ignorant. If nobody shows a little child, two, three years old, how to look for the way, the signs of the path, the landmarks, then it gets lost on the mountain, doesn’t it? And dies in the night, in the cold. So. So.” He rocked his body a little. \\n Maz Ottiar, across the little room, knocked on the drum, murmuring some long chronicle of ancient days to a single, sleepy, ten-year-old listener. \\n Maz Uming rocked and frowned. “So, without the telling, the rocks and plants and animals go on all right. But the people don’t. People wander around. They don’t know a mountain from its reflection in a puddle. They don’t know a path from a cliff. They hurt themselves. They get angry and hurt each other and the other things. They hurt animals because they’re angry. They make quarrels and cheat each other. They want too much. They neglect things. Crops don’t get planted. Too many crops get planted. Rivers get dirty with shit. Earth gets dirty with poison. People eat poison food. Everything is confused. Everybody’s sick. Nobody looks after the sick people, the sick things. But that’s very bad, very bad, eh? Because looking after things, that’s our job, eh? Looking after things, looking after each other. Who else would do it? Trees? Rivers? Animals? They just do what they are. But we’re here, and we have to learn how to be here, how to do things, how to keep things going the way they need to go. The rest of the world knows its business. Knows the One and the Myriad, the Tree and the Leaves. But all we know is how to learn. How to study, how to listen, how to talk, how to tell. If we don’t tell the world, we don’t know the world. We’re lost in it, we die. But we have to tell it right, tell it truly. Eh? Take care and tell it truly. That’s what went wrong. Down there, down there in Dovza, when they started telling lies. Those false maz, those big munan, those boss maz. Telling people that nobody knew the truth but them, nobody could speak but them, everybody had to tell the same lies they told. Traitors, usurers! Leading people astray for money! Getting rich off their lies, bossing people! No wonder the world stopped going around! No wonder the police took over!” \\n The old man was dark red in the face, shaking his good hand as if he held a stick in it. His wife got up, came over, and put the drum and drumstick into his hands, all the time going on with her droning recitation. Uming bit his lip, shook his head, fretted a bit, knocked the drum rather hard, and took up the recitation on the next line. \\n “I’m sorry,” Sutty said to Ottiar as the old woman went with her to the door. “I didn’t mean to upset Maz Uming.” \\n “Oh, it’s all right,” Ottiar said. “All that was before I/we were born. Down in Dovza.” \\n “You weren’t part of Dovza, up here?” \\n “We’re mostly Rangma here. My/our people all talked Rangma. The grandparents didn’t know how to talk much Dovzan till after the Corporation police came and made everybody talk it. They hated it! They kept the worst accents they could!” \\n She had a merry smile, and Sutty smiled back; but she walked down the hill-street in a maze of thoughts. Uming’s tirade against the ‘boss maz’ had been about the period  before  the Dovzan Corporation ruled the world, before ‘the police came,’ possibly before the First Observers of the Ekumen came. As he spoke, it had occurred to her that of the hundreds of stories and histories she had heard in the tellings, none had to do with events in Dovza, or any events of the last five or six decades except very local ones. She had never heard a maz tell a tale about the coming of the offworlders, the rise of the Corporation State, or any public event of the last seventy years or more. \\n “Iziezi,” she said that night, “who were the boss maz?” \\n She was helping Iziezi peel a kind of fungus that had just come into season up on the hills where the snow was melting at the edge of thawing drifts. It was called demyedi, first-of-spring, tasted like snow, and was good for balancing the peppery banam shoots and the richness of oilfish, thus keeping the sap thin and the heart easy. Whatever else she had missed and misunderstood in this world, she had learned when, and why, and how to cook its food. \\n “Oh, that was a long time ago,” said Iziezi. “When they started bossing everybody around, down in Dovza.” \\n “A hundred years ago?” \\n “Maybe that long ago.” \\n “Who are ‘the police’?” \\n “Oh, you know. The blue-and-tans.” \\n “Just them?” \\n “Well, I guess we call all those people the police. From down there. Dovzans…First they used to arrest the boss maz. Then they started to arrest all the maz. When they sent soldiers up here to arrest people in the umyazu, that’s when people started calling them police. And people call skuyen the police, too. Or they say, ‘They’re working for the police.”’ \\n “Skuyen?” \\n “People who tell the blue-and-tans about illegal things. Books, tellings, anything…For money. Or for hatred.” Iziezi’s mild voice changed on the last words. Her face had closed into its tight look of pain. \\n Books, tellings, anything. What you cooked. Who you made love with. How you wrote the word for tree. Anything. \\n No wonder the system was incoherent, fragmented. No wonder Uming’s world had stopped going around. The wonder was that anything remained of it at all. \\n As if her realisations had summoned him out of nothingness, the Monitor passed her on the street next morning. He did not look at her. \\n A few days later she went to visit Maz Sotyu Ang. His shop was closed. It had never been closed before. She asked a neighbor sweeping his front step if he would be back soon. “I think the producer-consumer is away,” the man said vaguely. \\n Maz Elyed had lent her a beautiful old book—lent or given, she was not sure. “Keep it, it’s safe with you,” Elyed had said. It was an ancient anthology of poems from the Eastern Isles, an inexhaustible treasure. She was deep in studying and transferring it into her noter. Several days passed before she thought to visit her old friend the Fertiliser again. She walked up the steep street that shone blinding black in the sunshine. Spring came late but fast to these foothills of the great range. The air blazed with light. She walked past the shop without recognising it. \\n She was disoriented, turned back, found the shop. It was all white: whitewashed, a blank front. All the signs, the bold characters, the old words gone. Silenced. Snowfall…The door stood ajar. She looked in. The counters and the walls of tiny drawers had been torn out. The room was empty, dirty, ransacked. The walls where she had seen the living words, the breathing words, had been smeared over with brown paint. \\n The twice-forked lightning tree… \\n The neighbor had come out when she passed. He was sweeping his step again. She began to speak to him and then did not. Skuyen? How did you know? \\n She started back home and then, seeing the river glittering at the foot of the streets, turned and went along the hillside out of town to a path that led down to and followed the river. She had hiked that path all one day, one of those days long, long ago in the early autumn when she was waiting for the Envoy to tell her to go back to the city. \\n She set off upriver beside thickets of newly leafed-out shrubs and the dwarfed trees that grew here not far from timberline. The Ereha ran milky blue with the first glacier melt. Ice crunched in the ruts of the road, but the sun was hot on her head and back. Her mouth was still dry with shock. Her throat ached. \\n Go back to the city. She should go back to the city. Now. With the three record crystals and the noter full of stuff, full of poetry. Get it all to Tong Ov before the Monitor got it. \\n There was no way to send it. She must take it. But travel must be authorised. O Ram! where was her ZIL? She hadn’t worn it for months. Nobody here used ZILs, only if you worked for the Corporation or had to go to one of the bureaus. It was in her briefcase, in her room. She’d have to use her ZIL at the telephone on Dock Street, get through to Tong, ask him to get her an authorisation to come to the city. By plane. Take the riverboat down to Eltli and fly from there. Do it all out in the open, let them all know, so they couldn’t stop her privately, trick her somehow. Confiscate her records. Silence her. Where was Maz Sotyu? What were they doing to him? Was it her fault? \\n She could not think about that now. What she had to do was save what she could of what Sotyu had given her. Sotyu and Ottiar and Uming and Odiedin and Elyed and Iziezi, dear Iziezi. She could not think about that now. \\n She turned round, walked hurriedly back along the river into town, found her ZIL bracelet in her briefcase in her room, went to Dock Street, and put in a call to Tong Ov at the Ekumenical Office in Dovza City. \\n His Dovzan secretary answered and said superciliously that he was in a meeting. “I must speak to him, now,” Sutty said and was not surprised when the secretary said in a meek tone that she would call him. \\n When Sutty heard his voice she said, in Hainish, hearing the words as foreign and strange, “Envoy, I’ve been out of touch for so long, I feel as if we needed to talk.” \\n “I see,” Tong said, and a few other meaningless things, while she and probably he tried to figure out how to say anything meaningful. If only he knew any of her languages, if only she knew his! But their only common languages were Hainish and Dovzan. \\n “Nothing devolving in particular?” he inquired. \\n “No, no, not really. But I’d like to bring you the material I’ve been collecting,” she said. “Just notes on daily life in Okzat-Ozkat.” \\n “I was hoping to come see you there, but that seems to be contraindicated at present,” Tong said. “With a window just wide enough for one, of course it’s a pity to close the blinds. But I know how much you love Dovza City and must have been missing it. I’m equally sure that you’ve found nothing much interesting up there. So, if your work’s all done, by all means come on back and enjoy yourself here.” \\n Sutty groped and stammered, and finally said, “Well, as you know it’s a very, the Corporation State is a very homogeneous culture, very powerful and definitely in control, very successful. So everything here is, yes, is very much the same here as there. But maybe I should stay on and finish the, finish the tapes before I bring them? They’re not very interesting.” \\n “Here, as you know,” said Tong, “our hosts share all kinds of information with us. And we share ours with them. Everybody here is getting loads of fresh material, very educational and inspiring. So what you’re doing there isn’t really all that important. Don’t worry about it. Of course I’m not at all uneasy about you. And have no need to be. Do I?” \\n “No, yes, of course not,” she said. “Honestly.” \\n She left the telephone office, showing her ZIL at the door, and hurried back to her inn, her home. She thought she had followed Tong’s backward talk, but it destroyed itself in her memory. She thought he had been trying to tell her to stay there, not to try to bring what she had to him, because he would have to show it to officials there and it would be confiscated, but she was not sure that was what he had meant. Maybe he truly meant it was not all that important. Maybe he meant he could not help her at all. \\n Helping Iziezi prepare dinner, she was sure that she had panicked, had been stupid to call Tong, thus bringing attention to herself and her friends and informants here. Feeling that she must be careful, cautious, she said nothing about the desecrated shop. \\n Iziezi had known Maz Sotyu Ang for years, but she said nothing about him either. She showed no sign of anything being wrong. She showed Sutty how to slice the fresh numiem, thin and on the bias, to bring the flavor out. \\n It was one of Elyed’s teaching nights. After she and Akidan and Iziezi had eaten, Sutty took her leave and went down River Street into the poor part of town, the yurt city, where the Corporation had not brought electric enlightenment and there were only the tiny gleams of oil lamps inside the shacks and tents. It was cold, but not the bone-dry, blade-keen cold of winter. A damp, spring-smelling cold, full of life. But Sutty’s heart swelled with dread as she came near Elyed’s shop: to find it all whited out, gutted, raped… \\n The great-grandnephew was screaming bloody murder as somebody separated him from a screwdriver, and nieces smiled at Sutty as she went through the shop to the back room. She was early for the teaching hour. Nobody was in the little room but the maz and an unobtrusive grandnephew setting up chairs. \\n “Maz Elyed Oni, do you know Maz Sotyu Ang—the herbalist—his shop—” She could not keep the words from bursting out. \\n “Yes,” the old woman said. “He’s staying with his daughter.” \\n “The shop, the herbary—” \\n “That is gone.” \\n “But-” \\n Her throat ached. She struggled with tears of rage and outrage that wanted to be cried, here with this woman who could be her grandmother, who was her grandmother. \\n “It was my fault.” \\n “No,” Elyed said. “You did no wrong. Sotyu Ang did no wrong. There is no fault. Things are going badly. It’s not possible always to do right when things are difficult.” \\n Sutty stood silent. She looked around the small, high-ceilinged room, its red rug almost hidden by chairs and cushions; everything poor, clean; a bunch of paper flowers stuck in an ugly vase on the low table; the grandnephew gently rearranging floor cushions; the old, old woman lowering herself carefully, painfully onto a thin pillow near the table. On the table, a book. Old, worn, many times read. \\n “I think maybe, yoz Sutty, it was the other way round. Sotyu told us last summer that he thought a neighbor had informed the police about his herbary. Then you came, and nothing happened.” \\n Sutty forced herself to understand what Elyed had said. “I was a safeguard?” \\n “I think so.” \\n “Because they don’t want me to see…what they do? But then why did they—now—?” \\n Elyed drew her thin shoulders together. “They don’t study patience,” she said. \\n “Then I should stay here,” Sutty said slowly, trying to understand. “I thought it would be better for you if I left.” \\n “I think you might go to Silong.” \\n Her mind was clouded. “To Silong?” \\n “The last umyazu is there.” \\n Sutty said nothing, and after a while Elyed added, scrupulous of fact, “The last I know of. Maybe some are left in the east, in the Isles. But here in the west they say the Lap of Silong is the last. Many, many books have been sent there. For many years now. It must be a great library. Not like the Golden Mountain, not like the Red Umyazu, not like Atangen. But what has been saved, most of it is there.” \\n She looked at Sutty, her head a little on one side, a small old bird, keen-eyed. She had completed her cautious journey down onto the cushion, and now arranged her black wool vest, a bird getting its feathers straight. “You want to learn the Telling, I know that. You should go there,” she said. “Here, nothing much is here. Bits and pieces. What I have, what a few maz have. Not much. Always less. Go to Silong, daughter Sutty. Maybe you can find a partner. Be a maz. Eh?” Her face creased up in a sudden, tremendous smile, toothless and radiant. She jiggled gently with laughter. “Go to Silong…” \\n Other people were coming in. Elyed put her hands in her lap and began to chant softly, “The two from one, the one from two…” \\n ',\n",
       " 'SIX \\n SHE WENT TO TALK  to Odiedin Manma. Despite his enigmatic telling, despite the uncanny event (which she was now quite sure she had merely imagined) in his class, she had found him the most worldly and politically knowledgeable of the maz she knew, and she badly wanted some practical counsel. She waited till after his class and then begged him for advice. \\n “Does Maz Elyed want me to go to this place, this umyazu, because she thinks if I go there, my presence will help keep it safe? I think she might be wrong. I think the blue-and-tans are tracking me all the time. It’s a secret place, a hidden place, isn’t it? If I went, they could just follow me. They may have all kinds of tracking devices.” \\n Odiedin held up his hand, mild but unsmiling. “I don’t think they’ll track you, yoz. They have orders from Dovza to let you be. Not to follow and observe you.” \\n “You know that?” \\n He nodded. \\n She believed him. She remembered the invisible web she had sensed when she first lived here. Odiedin was one of the spiders. \\n “Anyhow, the way to Silong isn’t an easy track to follow. And you could leave very quietly.” He chewed his lip a little. A hint of warmth, a pleasurable look, had come into his dark, severe face. “If Maz Elyed suggested that you go there, and if you want to go there,” he said, “I’d show you the way.” \\n “You would?” \\n “I was at the Lap of Silong once. I was twelve. My parents were maz. It was a bad time then. When the books were burned. A lot of police. A lot of loss, destruction. Arrests. Fear. So we left Okzat, went up into the hills, to the hill towns. And then, in the summer, all the way round Zubuam, to the lap of the Mother. I’d like very much to go that way again before I die, yoz.” \\n \\n Sutty tried to leave no track, ‘no footprints in the dust.’ She sent no word to Tong except that she planned to do nothing much the next few months except a little hiking and climbing. She spoke to none of her friends, acquaintances, teachers, except Elyed and Odiedin. She fretted about her crystals—four, now, for she had cleared her noter again. She could not leave them at Iziezi’s house, the first place the blue-and-tans would look for them. She was trying to decide where to bury them and how to do it without being seen, when Ottiar and Uming in the most casual way told her that since the police were so busy at the moment, they were storing their mandala away in a safe place for a while, and did she have anything she’d like to stash away with it? Their intuition seemed amazing, until Sutty remembered that they were part of the spiderweb—and had lived their adult lives in secrecy, hiding all that was most precious to them. She gave them the crystals. They told her where the hiding place was. “Just in case,” Ottiar said mildly. She told them who Tong Ov was and what to tell him, just in case. They parted with loving embraces. \\n Finally she told Iziezi about the long hike she planned to take in the mountains. \\n “Akidan is going with you,” Iziezi said with a cheerful smile. \\n Akidan was out with friends. The two women were eating dinner together at the table in the red-carpeted corner of Iziezi’s immaculate kitchen. It was a ‘little-feast’ night: several small dishes, delicately intense in flavor, surrounding a bland, creamy pile of tuzi. It reminded Sutty of the food of her far-off childhood. “You’d like basmati rice, Iziezi!” she said. Then she heard what her friend had said. \\n “Into the mountains? But it—We may be gone a long time.” \\n “He’s been up in the hills several times. He’ll be seventeen this summer.” \\n “But what will you do?” Akidan ran his aunt’s errands, did her shopping, sweeping, fetching and carrying, helped her when a crutch slipped. \\n “My cousin’s daughter will come stay with me.” \\n “Mizi? But she’s only six!” \\n “She’s a help.” \\n “Iziezi, I don’t know if this is a good idea. I may go a long way. Even stay the winter in one of the villages up there.” \\n “Dear Sutty, Ki isn’t your responsibility. Maz Odiedin Manma told him to come. To go with a teacher to the Lap of Silong is the dream of his life. He wants to be a maz. Of course he has to grow up and find a partner. Maybe finding a partner is what he’s mostly thinking about, just now.” She smiled a little, not so cheerfully. “His parents were maz,” she said. \\n “Your sister?” \\n “She was Maz Ariezi Meneng.” She used the forbidden pronoun, she/he/they. Her face had fallen into its set expression of pain. “They were young,” she said. A long pause. “Ki’s father, Meneng Ariezi, everybody loved him. He was like the old heroes, like Penan Teran, so handsome and brave…He thought being a maz was like armor. He believed nothing could hurt her/him/ them. There was a while, then, three or four years, when things were going along more like the old days. No arrests. No more troops of young people from down there breaking windows, painting everything white, shouting…It quieted down. The police didn’t come here much. We all thought it was over, it would go back to being like it used to be. Then all of a sudden there were a lot of them. That’s how they are. All of a sudden. They said there were, you know, too many people here breaking the law, reading, telling…They said they’d clean the city. They paid skuyen to inform on people. I knew people who took their money.” Her face was tight, closed. “A lot of people got arrested. My sister and her husband. They took them to a place called Erriak. Somewhere way off, down there. An island, I think. An island in the sea. A rehabilitation center. Five years ago we heard that Ariezi was dead. A notice came. We never have heard anything about Meneng Ariezi. Maybe he’s still alive.” \\n “How long ago…?” \\n “Twelve years.” \\n “Ki was four?” \\n “Nearly five. He remembers them a little. I try to help him remember them. I tell him about them.” \\n Sutty said nothing for a while. She cleared the table, came and sat down again. “Iziezi, you’re my friend. He’s your child. He  is  my responsibility. It could be dangerous. They could follow us.” \\n “Nobody follows the people of the Mountain to the Mountain, dear Sutty.” \\n They all had that serene, foolhardy confidence when they talked about the mountains. No blame. Nothing to fear. Maybe they had to think that way in order to go on at all. \\n Sutty bought a nearly weightless, miraculously insulated sleeping bag for herself, and one for Akidan. Iziezi protested pro forma. Akidan was delighted and, like a child, slept in his sleeping bag from that night on, sweltering. \\n She got her boots and fleeces out again, packed her backpack, and in the early morning of the appointed day walked with Akidan to the gathering place. It was spring on the edge of summer. The streets were dim blue in morning twilight, but up there to the northwest the great wall stood daylit, the peak was flying its radiant banners. We’re going there, Sutty thought, we’re going  there!  And she looked down to see if she was walking on the earth or on the air. \\n \\n Vast slopes rose up all round to hanging glaciers and the glare of hidden ice fields. Their group of eight trudged along in line, so tiny in such hugeness that they seemed to be walking in place. Far up above them wheeled two geyma, the long-winged carrion birds that dwelt only among the high peaks, and flew always in pairs. \\n Six had set out: Sutty, Odiedin, Akidan, a young woman named Kieri, and a maz couple in their thirties, Tobadan and Siez. In a hill village four days out from Okzat-Ozkat two guides had joined them, shy, gentle-mannered men with weathered faces, whose age was hard to determine—somewhere between thirty and seventy. They were named Ieyu and Long. \\n The group had gone up and down in those hills for a week before they ever came to what these people called mountains. Then they had begun to climb. They had climbed steadily, daily, for eleven days now. \\n The luminous wall of Silong looked exactly the same, no nearer. A couple of insignificant 5,000-meter peaks to the north had shifted place and shrunk a bit. The guides and the three maz, with their trained memory for descriptive details and figures, knew the names and heights of all the peaks. They used a measure of altitude, pieng. As well as Sutty could recall, 15,000 pieng was about 5,000 meters; but since she wasn’t certain her memory was correct, she mostly left the figures in pieng. She liked hearing these great heights, but she did not try to remember them, or the names of the mountains and passes. She had resolved before they set out never to ask where they were, where they were going, or how far they had yet to go. She had held to that resolve the more easily as it left her childishly free. \\n There was no trail as such except near villages, but there were charts that like river pilots’ charts gave the course by landmarks and alignments:  When the north scarp of Mien falls behind the Ears of Taziu…  Odiedin and the other maz pored over these charts nightly with the two guides who had joined them in the foothills. Sutty listened to the poetry of the words. She did not ask the names of the tiny villages they passed through. If the Corporation, or even the Ekumen, ever demanded to know the way to the Lap of Silong, she could say in all truth that she did not know it. \\n She didn’t know even the name of the place they were going to. She had heard it called the Mountain, Silong, the Lap of Silong, the Taproot, the High Umyazu. Possibly there was more than one place. She knew nothing about it. She resisted her desire to learn the name for everything, the word for everything. She was living among people to whom the highest spiritual attainment was to speak the world truly, and who had been silenced. Here, in this greater silence, where they could speak, she wanted to learn to listen to them. Not to question, only to listen. They had shared with her the sweetness of ordinary life lived mindfully. Now she shared with them the hard climb to the heights. \\n She had worried about her fitness for this trek. A month in the hill country of Ladakh and a few hiking holidays in the Chilean Andes were the sum of her mountaineering, and those had not been climbs, just steep walking. That was what they were doing now, but she wondered how high they would go. She had never walked above 4,000 meters. So far, though they must be that high by now, she had had no trouble except for running short of breath on stiff uphill stretches. Even Odiedin and the guides took it slow when the way got steep. Only Akidan and Kieri, a tough, rotund girl of twenty or so, raced up the endless slopes, and danced on outcroppings of granite over vast blue abysses, and were never out of breath. The eberdibi, the others called them—the kids, the calves. \\n They had walked a long day to get to a summer village: six or seven stone rings with yurts set up on them among steep, stony pastures tucked in the shelter of a huge curtain wall of granite. Sutty had been amazed to find how many people lived up here where it seemed there was nothing to live on but air and ice and rock. The vast, barren-seeming foothills far above Okzat-Ozkat had turned out to be full of villages, pasturages, small stone-walled fields. Even here among the high peaks there were habitations, the summer villages. Villagers came up from the hills through the late spring snow with their animals, the kind of eberdin called minule. Horned, half wild, with long legs and long pale wool, the minule pastured as high as grass grew and bore their young in the highest alpine meadows. Their fine, silky fleece was valuable even now in the days of artificial fibers. The villagers sold their wool, drank their milk, tanned their hides for shoes and clothing, burned their dung for fuel. \\n These people had lived this way forever. To them Okzat-Ozkat, a far provincial outpost of civilisation, was civilisation. They were all Rangma. They spoke some Dovzan in the foothills, and Sutty could converse well enough with Ieyu and Long; but up here, though her Rangma had improved greatly over the winter, she had to struggle to understand the mountain dialect. \\n The villagers all turned out to welcome the visitors, a jumble of dirty sunburnt smiling faces, racing children, shy babies laced into leather cocoons and hung up on stakes like little trophies, blatting minule with their white, silent, newborn young. Life, life abounding in the high, empty places. \\n Overhead, as always, were a couple of geyma spiraling lazily on slender dark wings in the dark dazzling blue. \\n Odiedin and the young maz couple, Siez and Tobadan, were already busy blessing huts and babies and livestock, salving sores and smoke-damaged eyes, and telling. The blessing, if that was the right word for it—the word they used meant something like including or bringing in—consisted of ritual chanting to the tabatt-batt-batt of the little drum, and handing out slips of red or blue paper on which the maz wrote the recipients name and age and whatever autobiographical facts they asked to have written, such as— \\n “Married with Temazi this winter.” \\n “Built my house in the village.” \\n “Bore a son this winter past. He lived one day and night. His name was Enu.” \\n “Twenty-two minulibi born this season to my flock.” \\n “I am Ibien. I was six years old this spring.” \\n As far as she could tell, the villagers could read only a few characters or none at all. They handled the written slips of paper with awe and deep satisfaction. They examined them for a long time from every direction, folded them carefully, slipped them into special pouches or finely decorated boxes in their house or tent. The maz had done a blessing or ingathering like this in every village they passed through that did not have a maz of its own. Some of the telling boxes in village houses, magnificently carved and decorated, had hundreds of these little red and blue record slips in them, tellings of lives present, lives past. \\n Odiedin was writing these for a family, Tobadan was dispensing herbs and salve to another family, and Siez, having finished the chant, had sat down with the rest of the population to tell. A narrow-eyed, taciturn young man, Siez in the villages became a fountain of words. \\n Tired and a little buzzy-headed—they must have come up another kilometer today—and liking the warmth of the afternoon sun, Sutty joined the half circle of intently gazing men and women and children, cross-legged on the stony dust, and listened with them. \\n “The telling!” Siez said, loudly, impressively, and paused. \\n His audience made a soft sound,  ah, ah,  and murmured to one another. \\n “The telling of a story!” \\n Ah, ah,  murmur, murmur. \\n “The story is of Dear Takieki!” \\n Yes, yes. The dear Takieki, yes. \\n “Now the story begins! Now, the story begins when dear Takieki was still living with his old mother, being a grown man, but foolish. His mother died. She was poor. All she had to leave him was a sack of bean meal that she had been saving for them to eat in the winter. The landlord came and drove Takieki out of the house.” \\n Ah, ah,  the listeners murmured, nodding sadly. \\n “So there went Takieki walking down the road with the sack of bean meal slung over his shoulder. He walked and he walked, and on the next hill, walking toward him, he saw a ragged man. They met in the road. The man said, ‘That’s a heavy sack you carry, young man. Will you show me what is in it?’ So Takieki did that. ‘Bean meal!’ says the ragged man.” \\n Bean meal,  whispered a child. \\n “‘And what fine bean meal it is! But it’ll never last you through the winter. I’ll make a bargain with you, young man. I’ll give you a real brass button for that bean meal!’ \\n “‘Oh, ho,’ says Takieki, ‘you think you’re going to cheat me, but I’m not so foolish as that!’” \\n Ah, ah. \\n “So Takieki hoisted his sack and went on. And he walked and he walked, and on the next hill, coming toward him, he saw a ragged girl. They met in the road, and the girl said, ‘A heavy sack you’re carrying, young man. How strong you must be! May I see what’s in it?’ So Takieki showed her the bean meal, and she said, ‘Fine bean meal! If you’ll share it with me, young man, I’ll go along with you, and I’ll make love with you whenever you like, as long as the bean meal lasts.’” \\n A woman nudged the woman sitting by her, grinning. \\n “‘Oh, ho,’ says Takieki, ‘you think you’re going to cheat me, but I’m not so foolish as that!’ \\n “And he slung his sack over his shoulder and went on. And he walked and he walked, and on the next hill, coming toward him, he saw a man and woman.” \\n Ah, ah,  very softly. \\n “The man was dark as dusk and the woman bright as dawn, and they wore clothing all of bright colors and jewels of bright colors, red, blue. They met in the road, and he/she/they said, ‘What a heavy sack you carry, young man. Will you show us what’s in it?’ So Takieki did that. Then the maz said, ‘What fine bean meal! But it will never last you through the winter.’ Takieki did not know what to say. The maz said, ‘Dear Takieki, if you give us the sack of bean meal your mother gave you, you may have the farm that lies over that hill, with five barns full of grain, and five storehouses full of meal, and five stables full of eberdin. Five great rooms are in the farmhouse, and its roof is of coins of gold. And the mistress of the house is in the house, waiting to be your wife.’ \\n “‘Oh, ho,’ said Takieki. ‘You think you’re going to cheat me, but I’m not so foolish as that!’ \\n “And he walked on and he walked on, over the hill, past the farm with five barns and five storehouses and five stables and a roof of gold, and so he went walking on, the dear Takieki.” \\n Ah, ah, ah!  said all the listeners, with deep contentment. And they relaxed from their intensity of listening, and chatted a little, and brought Siez a cup and a pot of hot tea so that he could refresh himself, and waited respectfully for whatever he would tell next. \\n Why was Takieki ‘dear’? Sutty wondered. Because he was foolish? (Bare feet standing on air.) Because he was wise? But would a wise man have distrusted the maz? Surely he was foolish to turn down the farm and five barns and a wife. Did the story mean that to a holy man a farm and barns and a wife aren’t worth a bag of bean meal? Or did it mean that a holy man, an ascetic, is a fool? The people she had lived with this year honored self-restraint but did not admire self-deprivation. They had no strenuous notions of fasting, and saw no virtue whatever in discomfort, hunger, poverty. \\n If it had been a Terran parable, most likely Takieki ought to have given the ragged man the bean meal for the brass button, or just given it for nothing, and then when he died he’d get his reward in heaven. But on Aka, reward, whether spiritual or fiscal, was immediate. By his performance of a maz’s duties, Siez was not building up a bank account of virtue or sanctity; in return for his story-telling he would receive praise, shelter, dinner, supplies for their journey, and the knowledge that he had done his job. Exercises were performed not to attain an ideal of health or longevity but to achieve immediate well-being and for the pleasure of doing them. Meditation aimed toward a present and impermanent transcendance, not an ultimate nirvana. Aka was a cash, not a credit, economy. \\n Therefore their hatred of usury. A fair bargain and payment on the spot. \\n But then, what about the girl who offered to share what she had if he’d share what he had. Wasn’t that a fair bargain? \\n Sutty puzzled over it all through the next tale, a famous bit of  The Valley War  that she had heard Siez tell several times in villages in the foothills—“I can tell that one when I’m sound asleep,” he said. She decided that a good deal depended on how aware Takieki was of his own simplicity. Did he know the girl might trick him? Did he know he wasn’t capable of managing a big farm? Maybe he did the right thing, hanging on to what his mother gave him. Maybe not. \\n As soon as the sun dropped behind the mountain wall to the west, the air in that vast shadow dropped below freezing. Everyone huddled into the hut-tents to eat, choking in the smoke and reek. The travelers would sleep in their own tents set up alongside the villagers’ larger ones. The villagers would sleep naked, unwashed, promiscuous under heaps of silken pelts full of grease and fleas. In the tent she shared with Odiedin, Sutty thought about them before she slept. Brutal people, primitive people, the Monitor had said, leaning on the rail of the riverboat, looking up the long dark rise of the land that hid the Mountain. He was right. They were primitive, dirty, illiterate, ignorant, superstitious. They refused progress, hid from it, knew nothing of the March to the Stars. They hung on to their sack of bean meal. \\n \\n Ten days or so after that, camped on névé in a long, shallow valley among pale cliffs and glaciers, Sutty heard an engine, an airplane or helicopter. The sound was distorted by wind and echoes. It might have been quite near or bounced from mountainside to mountainside from a long way off. There was ground fog blowing in tatters, a high overcast. Their tents, dun-colored, in the lee of an icefall, might be invisible in the vast landscape or might be plain to see from the air. They all held still as long as they could hear the stutter and rattle in the wind. \\n That was a weird place, the long valley. Icy air flowed down into it from the glaciers and pooled on its floor. Ghosts of mist snaked over the dead white snow. \\n Their food supplies were low. Sutty thought they must be close to their goal. \\n Instead of climbing up out of the long valley as she had expected, they descended from it on a long, wide slope of boulders. The wind blew without a pause and so hard that the gravel chattered ceaselessly against the larger stones. Every step was difficult, and every breath. Looking up now they saw Silong palpably nearer, the great barrier wall reaching across the sky. But the bannered crest still stood remote behind it. All Sutty’s dreams that night were of a voice she could hear but could not understand, a jewel she had found but could not touch. \\n The next day they kept going down, down steeply, to the southwest. A chant formed itself in Sutty’s dulled mind:  Go back to go forward, fail to succeed. Go down to go upward, fail to succeed.  It would not get out of her head but thumped itself over and over at every jolting step. Go  down  to go  up ward,  fail  to  succeed … \\n They came to a path across the slope of stones, then to a road, to a wall of stones, to a building of stone. Was this their journey’s end? Was this the Lap of the Mother? But it was only a stopping place, a shelter. Maybe it had been an umyazu once. It was silent now. It held no stories. They stayed two days and nights in the cheerless house, resting, sleeping in their sleeping bags. There was nothing to make a fire with, only their tiny cookers, and no food left but dried smoked fish, which they shared out in little portions, soaking it in boiled snow to make soup. \\n “They’ll come,” people said. She did not ask who. She was so tired, she thought she could lie forever in the stone house, like one of the inhabitants of the little white stone houses in the cities of the dead she had seen in South America, resting in peace. Her own people burned their dead. She had always dreaded fire. This was better, the cold silence. \\n On the third morning she heard bells, a long way off, a faint jangling of little bells. “Come see, Sutty,” Kieri said, and coaxed her to get up and stand in the door of the stone house and look out. \\n People were coming up from the south, winding among the grey boulders that stood higher than they did, people leading minule laden with packs on high saddles. There were poles fixed to the saddles, and from them long red and blue ribbons snapped in the wind. Clusters of little bells were tied into the white neck wool of the young animals that ran beside their mothers. \\n The next day they started down with the people and the animals to their summer village. It took them three days, but the going was mostly easy. The villagers wanted Sutty to ride one of the minule, but nobody else was riding. She walked. At one place they had to round a cliff under a precipice that continued vertically down from the narrow ledge of the pathway. The path was level, but no wider than a foot’s breadth in places, and the snow on it was softened and loosened by the summer thaw. There they let the minule loose and instead of leading them followed them. They showed Sutty that she should put her feet in the animals’ tracks. She followed one minule meticulously, step by step. Its woolly buttocks swaying nonchalantly, it sauntered along, pausing now and then to look down the sheer drop into the hazy depths with a bored expression. Nobody said anything till they were all off the cliff path. Then there was some laughter and joking, and several villagers made the mountain-heart gesture to Silong. \\n Down in the village the horned peak could not be seen, only the big shoulder of a nearer mountain and a glimpse of the barrier wall closing off the northwestern sky. The village was in a green place, open to north and south, good summer pasturage, sheltered, idyllic. Trees grew by the river: Odiedin showed them to her. They were as tall as her little finger. Down in Okzat-Ozkat such trees were the shrubs beside the Ereha. In the parks of Dovza City she had walked in their deep shade. \\n There had been a death among the people, a young man who had neglected a cut on his foot and died of blood poisoning. They had kept the body frozen in snow till the maz could come and perform his funeral. How had they known Odiedin’s group was coming? How had these arrangements been made? She didn’t understand, but she didn’t think about it much. Here in the mountains there was much she didn’t understand. She went along in the moment, like a child. “Tumble and spin and be helpless, like a baby…” Who had said that to her? She was content to walk, content to sit in the sun, content to follow in the footsteps of an animal.  Where my guides lead me in kindness, I follow, follow lightly… \\n The two young maz told the funeral. That was how the people spoke of it. Like all the rites, it was a narrative. For two days Siez and Tobadan sat with the man’s father and aunt, his sister, his friends, a woman who had been married to him for a while, hearing everybody who wanted to talk about him tell them who he had been, what he had done. Now the two young men retold all that, ceremonially and in the formal language, to the soft batt-tabatt of the drum, passing the word one to the other across the body wrapped in white, thin, still-frozen cloth: a praise-song, gathering a life up into words, making it part of the endless telling. \\n Then Siez recited in his beautiful voice the ending of the story of Penan Teran, a mythic hero couple dear to the Rangma people. Penan and Teran were men of Silong, young warriors who rode the north wind, saddling the wind from the mountains like an eberdin and riding it down to battle, banners flying, to fight the ancient enemy of the Rangma, the sea people, the barbarians of the western plains. But Teran was killed in battle. And Penan led his people out of danger and then saddled the south wind, the sea wind, and rode it up into the mountains, where he leapt from the wind and died. \\n The people listened and wept, and there were tears in Sutty’s eyes. \\n Then Tobadan struck the drum as Sutty had never heard it struck, no soft heartbeat but a driving urgent rhythm, to which people lifted up the body and carried it away in procession, swiftly away from the village, always with the drum beating. \\n “Where will they bury him?” she asked Odiedin. \\n “In the bellies of the geyma,” Odiedin said. He pointed to distant rock spires on one of the mighty slopes above the valley. “They’ll leave him naked there.” \\n That was better than lying in a stone house, Sutty thought. Better far than fire. \\n “So he’ll ride the wind,” she said. \\n Odiedin looked up at her and after a while quietly assented. \\n Odiedin never said much, and what he said was often dry; he was not a mild man; but she was by now altogether at ease with him and he with her. He was writing on the little slips of blue and red paper, of which he had a seemingly endless supply in his pack: writing the name and family names of the man who had died, she saw, for those who mourned him to take home and keep in their telling boxes. \\n “Maz,” she said. “Before the Dovzans became so powerful…before they began changing everything, using machinery, making things in factories instead of by hand, making new laws—all that—” Odiedin nodded. “It was after people from the Ekumen came here that they began that. Only about a lifetime ago. What were the Dovzans before that?” \\n “Barbarians.” \\n He was a Rangma; he hadn’t been able to resist saying it, saying it loud and clear. But she knew he was also a thoughtful, truthful man. \\n “Were they ignorant of the Telling?” \\n A pause. He set his pen down. “Long ago, yes. In the time of Penan Teran, yes. When  The Arbor  was written, yes. Then the people from the central plains, from Doy, began taming them. Trading with them, teaching them. So they learned to read and write and tell. But they were still barbarians, yoz Sutty. They’d rather make war than trade. When they traded, they made a war of it. They allowed usury, and sought great profits. They always had headmen to whom they paid tribute, men who were rich, and passed power down to their sons. Gobey—bosses. So when they began to have maz, they made the maz into bosses, with the power to rule and punish. Gave the maz the power to tax. They made them rich. They made the sons of maz all maz, by birth. They made the ordinary people into nothing. It was wrong. It was all wrong.” \\n “Maz Uming Ottiar spoke of that time once. As if he remembered it.” \\n Odiedin nodded. “I remember the end of it. It was a bad time. Not as bad as this,” he added, with his brief, harsh laugh. \\n “But this time came from that time. Grew out of it. Didn’t it?” \\n He looked dubious, thoughtful. \\n “Why don’t you tell of it?” \\n No response. \\n “You don’t tell it, maz. It’s never part of all the histories and tales you tell about the whole world all through the ages. You tell about the far past. And you tell things from your own years, from ordinary people’s lives—at funerals, and when children speak their tellings. But you don’t tell about these great events. Nothing about how the world has changed in the last hundred years.” \\n “None of that is part of the Telling,” Odiedin said after a tense, pondering silence. “We tell what is right, what goes right, as it should go. Not what goes wrong.” \\n “Penan Teran lost their battle, a battle with Dovza. It didn’t go right, maz. But you tell it.” \\n He looked up and studied her, not aggressively or with resentment, but from a very great distance. She had no idea what he was thinking or feeling, what he would say. \\n In the end he said only, “Ah.” \\n The land mine going off? or the soft assent of the listener? She did not know. \\n He bent his head and wrote the name of the dead man, three bold, elegant characters across the slip of faded red paper. He had ground his ink from a block he carried, mixed it with river water in a tiny stoneware pot. The pen he was using for this writing was a geyma feather, ash-grey. He might have sat here cross-legged on the stony dust, writing a name, three hundred years ago. Three thousand years ago. \\n She had no business asking him what she had asked him. Wrong, wrong. \\n But the next day he said to her, “Maybe you’ve heard the Riddles of the Telling, yoz Sutty?” \\n “I don’t think so.” \\n “Children learn them. They’re very old. What children tell is always the same.  What’s the end of a story? When you begin telling it.  That’s one of them.” \\n “More a paradox than a riddle,” Sutty said, thinking it over. “So the events must be over before the telling begins?” \\n Odiedin looked mildly surprised, as the maz generally did when she tried to interpret a saying or tale. \\n “That’s not what it means,” she said with resignation. \\n “It might mean that,” he said. And after a while, “Penan leapt from the wind and died: that is Teran’s story.” \\n She had thought he was answering her question about why the maz did not tell about the Corporation State and the abuses that had preceded it. What did the ancient heroes have to do with that? \\n There was a gap between her mind and Odiedin’s so wide light would need years to cross it. \\n “So the story went right, it’s right to tell it; you see?” Odiedin said. \\n “I’m trying to see,” she said. \\n \\n They stayed six days in the summer village in the deep valley, resting. Then they set off again with new provisions and two new guides, north and up. And up, and up. Sutty kept no count of the days. Dawn came, they got up, the sun shone on them and on the endless slopes of rock and snow, and they walked. Dusk came, they camped, the sound of water ceased as the little thaw streams froze again, and they slept. \\n The air was thin, the way was steep. To the left, towering over them, rose the scarps and slopes of the mountain they were on. Behind them and to the right, peak after far peak rose out of mist and shadow into light, a motionless sea of icy broken waves to the remote horizon. The sun beat like a white drum in the dark blue sky. It was midsummer, avalanche season. They went very soft and silent among the unbalanced giants. Again and again in the daytime the silence quivered into a long, shuddering boom, multiplied and made sourceless by echoes. \\n Sutty heard people say the name of the mountain they were on, Zubuam. A Rangma word: Thunderer. \\n They had not seen Silong since they left the deep village. Zubuam’s vast, deeply scored bulk closed off all the west. They inched along, north and up, north and up, in and out of the enormous wrinkles of the mountain’s flank. \\n Breathing was slow work. \\n One night it began to snow. It snowed lightly but steadily all the next day. \\n Odiedin and the two guides who had joined them at the deep village squatted outside the tents that evening and conferred, sketching out lines, paths, zigzags on the snow with gloved fingers. Next morning the sun leapt brilliant over the icy sea of the eastern peaks. They inched on, sweating, north and up. \\n One morning as they walked, Sutty realised they were turning their backs to the sun. Two days they went northwest, crawling around the immense shoulder of Zubuam. On the third day at noon they turned a corner of rock and ice. Before them the immense barrier faced them across a vast abyss of air: Silong breaking like a white wave from the depths to the regions of light. The day was diamond-bright and still. The tip of the horned peak could be seen above the ramparts. From it the faintest gossamer wisp of silver trailed to the north. \\n The south wind was blowing, the wind Penan had leapt from to die. \\n “Not far now,” Siez said as they trudged on, southwestward and down. \\n “I think I could walk here forever,” Sutty said, and her mind said, I  will … \\n During their stay in the deep village, Kieri had moved into her tent. They had been the only women in the group before the new guides joined them. Until then Sutty had shared Odiedin’s tent. A widowed maz, celibate, silent, orderly, he had been a self-effacing, reassuring presence. Sutty was reluctant to make the change, but Kieri pressed her to. Kieri had tented with Akidan till then and was sick of it. She told Sutty, “Ki’s seventeen, he’s in rut all the time. I don’t like boys! I like men and women! I want to sleep with you. Do you want to? Maz Odiedin can share with Ki.” \\n Her use of the words was specific:  share  meant share the tent,  sleep  meant join the sleeping bags. \\n When she realised that, Sutty was more hesitant than ever; but the passivity she had encouraged in herself during the whole of this journey was stronger than her hesitations, and she agreed. Nothing about sex had mattered much to her since Pao’s death. Sometimes her body craved to be touched and roused. Sex was something people wanted and needed. She could respond physically, so long as that was all they asked. \\n Kieri was strong, soft, warm, and as clean as any of them could be in the circumstances. “Let’s heat up!” she said every night as she got into their joined sleeping bags. She made love to Sutty briefly and energetically and then fell asleep pressed up close against her. They were like two logs in a glowing campfire, burning down, Sutty thought, sinking asleep in the deep warmth. \\n Akidan had been honored to share the tent with his master and teacher, but he was miffed or frustrated by Kieri’s desertion. He moped around her for a day or two, and then became attentive to the woman who had joined them in the village. The new guides were a brother and sister, a long-legged, round-faced, tireless pair in their twenties, named Naba and Shui. After a day or so Ki moved in with Shui. Odiedin, patient, invited Naba to share his tent. \\n What had Diodi the barrow man said, years ago, light-years away, back down there in the streets where people lived? “Sex for three hundred years! After three-hundred-year sex anybody can fly!” \\n I can fly, Sutty thought, plodding on, southward and down. There’s nothing really in the world but stone and light. All the other things, all the things, dissolve back into the two, the stone, the light, and the two back into the one, the flying…And then it will all be born again, it is born again, always, in every moment it’s being born, but all the time there’s only the one, the flying…She plodded on through glory. \\n They came to the Lap of the Earth. \\n Though she knew it was implausible, impossible, foolish, Sutty’s imagination had insisted all along that the goal of their journey was a great temple, a mysterious city hidden at the top of the world, stone ramparts, flags flying, priests chanting, gold and gongs and processions. All the imagery of lost Lhasa, Dragon-Tiger Mountain, Machu Picchu. All the ruins of the Earth. \\n They came steeply down the western flanks of Zubuam for three days in cloudy weather, seldom able to see the barrier wall of Silong across the vast gulf of air where the wind chased coiling clouds and ghostly snow flurries that never came to earth. They followed the guides all one day through cloud and fog along an arête, a long spine of snow-covered rock with a steep drop to either side. \\n The weather cleared suddenly, clouds gone, sun blazing at the zenith. Sutty was disoriented, looking up for the barrier wall and not finding it. Odiedin came beside her. He said, smiling, “We’re on Silong.” \\n They had crossed over. The enormous mass of rock and ice behind them in the east was Zubuam. An avalanche went curling and smoking down a slanting face of the rock far up on the mountain. A long time later they heard the deep roar of it, the Thunderer telling them what it had to tell. \\n Zubuam and Silong, they were two and one, too. Old maz mountains. Old lovers. \\n She looked up at Silong. The heights of the barrier wall loomed directly over them, hiding the summit peak. Sky was a brilliant, jagged-edged slash from north to south. \\n Odiedin was pointing to the south. She looked and saw only rock, ice, the glitter of thaw water. No towers, no banners. \\n They set off, trudging along. They were on a path, level and quite clear, marked here and there with piles of flat stones. Often Sutty saw the dry, neat pellets of minule dung beside the way. \\n In mid-afternoon she made out a pair of rock spires that stuck up from a projecting corner of the mountain ahead like tusks from the lower jaw of a skull. The path narrowed as they got closer to this corner, becoming a ledge along a sheer cliff. When they got to the corner, the two reddish tusks of rock stood before them like a gateway, the path leading between them. \\n Here they stopped. Tobadan brought out his drum and patted it, and the three maz spoke and chanted. The words were all in Rangma and so old or so formalised that Sutty could not follow their meaning. The two guides from the village and their own guides delved into their packs and brought out little bundles of twigs tied with red and blue thread. They gave them to the maz, who received them with the mountain-heart gesture, facing toward Silong. They set them afire and fixed them among rocks by the pathway to burn down. The smoke smelled like sage, a dry incense. It curled small and blue and lazy among the rocks and along the path. The wind whistled by, a river of turbulent air rushing through the great gap between the mountains, but here in this gateway Silong sheltered them and there was no wind at all. \\n They picked up their packs and fell into line again, passing between the saber-tooth rocks. The path now bent back inward toward the slope of the mountain, and Sutty saw that it led across a cirque, a level-floored half-moon bay in the mountainside. In the nearly vertical, curving inner wall, still a half kilo or so distant, were black spots or holes. There was some snow on the floor of the cirque, trodden in an arabesque of paths leading to and from these black holes in the mountain. \\n Caves , scarred Adien, the ex-miner, who had died of the jaundice in the winter, whispered in her mind.  Caves full of being. \\n The air seemed to thicken like syrup and to quiver, to shake. She was dizzy. Wind roared in her ears, deep and shrill, terrible. But they were out of the wind, here in the sunlit air of the cirque. She turned back in confusion, then in terror looked upward for the rockslide clattering down upon her. Black shadows crossed the air, the roar and rattle were deafening. She cowered, covering her head with her arms. \\n Silence. \\n She looked up, stood up. The others were all standing, like her, statues in the bright sunlight, pools of black shadow at their feet. \\n Behind them, between the tusks, the gateway rocks, something hung or lay crumpled. It gleamed blindingly and was shadow-black, like a lander seen from the ship in space. A lander—a flyer—a helicopter. She saw the rotor vane jammed up against the outer rock spire. “O Ram,” she said. \\n “Mother Silong,” Shui whispered, her clenched hand at her heart. \\n Then they started back toward the gate, toward the thing, Akidan in the lead, running. \\n “Wait, Akidan!” Odiedin shouted, but the boy was already there at the thing, the wreck. He shouted something back. Odiedin broke into a run. \\n Sutty could not breathe. She had to stand a while and still her heart. The older of their guides from the foothill country, Long, a kind, shy man, stood beside her, also trembling, also trying to breathe evenly, easily. They had come down, but they were still at 18,000 pieng, she had heard Siez say, 6,000 meters, a thin air, a terribly thin air. She said the numbers in her head. \\n “You all right, yoz Long?” \\n “Yes. You all right, yoz Sutty?” \\n They went forward together. \\n She heard Kieri talking: “I saw it, I looked around—I couldn’t believe it—it was trying to fly between the pillars—” \\n “No, I saw it, it was out there, coming up alongside the pass, coming after us, and then it seemed like a flaw of wind hit it, and tipped it sideways, and just threw it down between the rocks!” That was Akidan. \\n “She took it in her hands,” said Naba, the man from the deep village. \\n The three maz were at the wreck, in it. \\n Shui was kneeling near it, smashing something furiously, methodically, with a rock. The remains of a transmitter, Sutty saw. Stone Age revenge, her mind said coldly. \\n Her mind seemed to be very cold, detached from the rest of her, as if frostbitten. \\n She went closer and looked at the smashed helicopter. It had burst open in a strange way. The pilot was hanging in his seat straps, almost upside down. His face was mostly hidden by a blood-soaked woollen scarf. She saw his eyes, bits of jelly. \\n On the stony ground, between Odiedin and Siez, another man lay. His eyes were alive. He was staring up at her. After a while she recognised him. \\n Tobadan, the healer, was quickly, lightly running his hands over the man’s body and limbs, though surely he couldn’t tell much through the heavy clothing. He kept talking as if to keep the man awake. “Can you take off your helmet?” he asked. After a while the man tried to comply, fumbling with the fastening. Tobadan helped him. He continued gazing up at Sutty with a look of dull puzzlement. His face, always set and hard, was now slack. \\n “Is he hurt?” \\n “Yes,” Tobadan said. “This knee. His back. Not broken, I think.” \\n “You were lucky,” Sutty’s cold mind said, speaking aloud. \\n The man stared, looked away, made a weak gesture, tried to sit up. Odiedin pressed down gently on his shoulders, saying, “Be quiet. Wait. Sutty, don’t let him get up. We need to get the other man out. People will be here soon.” \\n Looking back into the cirque, toward the caves, she saw little figures hurrying to them across the snow. \\n She took Odiedin’s place, standing over the Monitor. He lay flat on the dirt with his arms crossed on his chest. He shuddered violently every now and then. She herself was shivering. Her teeth chattered. She wrapped her arms around her body. \\n “Your pilot is dead,” she said. \\n He said nothing. He trembled. \\n Suddenly there were people around them. They worked with efficiency, strapping the man onto a makeshift stretcher and lifting it and setting off for the caves, all within a minute or two. Others carried the dead man. Some gathered around Odiedin and the young maz. There was a soft buzz of voices that did nothing but buzz in Sutty’s head, meaningless as the speech of flies. \\n She looked for Long, joined him, and walked with him across the cirque. It was farther than it had seemed to the mountain wall and the entrance to the caves. Overhead a pair of geyma soared in long, lazy spirals. The sun was already behind the top of the barrier wall. Silong’s vast shadow rose blue against Zubuam. \\n The caves were like nothing she had ever seen. There were many of them, hundreds, some tiny, no more than bubbles in the rock, some big as the doors of hangars. They made a lacework of circles interlocking and overlapping in the wall of rock, patterns, traceries. The edges of the entrances were fretted with clusters of lesser circles, silvery stone shining against black shadow, like soapsuds, like foam, like the edges of Mandelbrot figures. \\n Against one entrance a little fence had been set up. Sutty looked in as they passed, and the white face of a young minule looked back at her with dark, quiet eyes. There was a whole stable of the animals built back into the caves. She could smell the pungent, warm, grassy odor of them. The entrances to the caves had been widened and brought down to ground level where necessary, but they kept their circularity. The people she and Long were following entered one of these great round doors into the mountain. Inside, she looked back for a moment at the entrance and saw daylight as a blazing, perfect circle set in dead black. \\n ',\n",
       " 'SEVEN \\n IT WAS NOT  a city with banners and golden processions, a temple with drums and bells and the chanting of priests. It was very cold, very dark, very poor. It was silent. \\n Food, bedding, oil for lamps, stoves and heating devices, everything that made it possible for anyone to live at the Lap of Silong had to be brought up from the eastern hill country on the backs of minules or human beings, little by little, in tiny caravans that would attract no attention, during the few months when it was possible to reach the place at all. In the summer thirty or forty men and women stayed there, living in the caves. Some of them brought books, papers, texts of the Telling. They stayed to arrange and protect all the books already there, the thousands and thousands of volumes brought over the decades from all over the great continent. They stayed to read and study, to be with the books, to be in the caves full of being. \\n Sutty moved in her first days there through a dream of darkness, strangeness. The caves themselves were bewildering: endless bubble chambers interconnecting, interfacing, dark walls, floors, ceilings all curved into one another seamlessly, so disorienting that sometimes she felt she was floating weightless. Sounds echoed so they had no direction. There was never enough light. \\n Her group of pilgrims set up their tents in a great vaulted chamber and slept in them, huddled into them for warmth as they had done during their trek. In other caves were other little constellations of tents. One maz couple had taken a three-meter, almost perfectly spherical hollow and made a private nest of it. Cookstoves and tables were in a large, flat-floored cave that received daylight through a couple of high vents, and everybody met there at mealtimes. The cooks scrupulously shared out the food. Never quite enough, and the same few things over and over: thin tea, boiled bean meal, dry cheese, dried leaves of spinach-like yota, a taste of hot pickle. Winter food, though it was summer. Food for the roots, for endurance. \\n The maz and the students and guides staying there this summer were all from the north and east, the vast hill countries and plains of the continent’s center, Amareza, Doy, Kangnegne. These maz were city people, far more learned and sophisticated than those of the little hill city Sutty knew. Trained in a profound and still unbroken intellectual and bodily and spiritual discipline, heirs to a tradition vaster, even in its ruin and enforced secrecy, than she had ever conceived, they had an impersonality about them as well as great personal authority. They did not play the pundit (Uncle Hurree’s phrase), but even the mildest of them was surrounded by a kind of aura or field—Sutty hated such words yet had to use them—that kept one from informal approach. They were aloof, absorbed in the telling, the books, the treasures of the caves. \\n The morning after the newcomers’ arrival, the maz named Igneba and Ikak took them to and through what they called the Library. Numbers daubed in luminous paint over the openings corresponded to a chart of the caves that the maz showed them. By going always to a lower number, if you lost your way in the labyrinth—and it was quite easy to do so—you would always return to the outer caves. The man, Igneba Ikak, carried an electric torch, but like so much Akan manufacture it was unreliable or defective and kept failing. Ikak Igneba carried an oil lantern. From it once or twice she lighted lamps hanging on the walls, to illuminate the caves of being, the round rooms full of words, where the Telling lay hidden, in silence. Under rock, under snow. \\n Books, thousands of books, in leather and cloth and wooden and paper bindings, unbound manuscripts in carved and painted boxes and jewelled caskets, fragments of ancient writing blazing with gold leaf, scrolls in tubes and boxes or tied with tape, books on vellum, parchment, rag paper, pulp paper, handwritten, printed, books on the floors, in boxes, in small crates, on rickety low shelves made of scrap wood from the crates. In one big cave the volumes stood ranked on two shelves, at waist height and eye level, dug into the walls right around the circumference. Those shelves were the work of long ago, Ikak said, carved by maz living here when it was a small umyazu and that one room had been all its library. Those maz had had the time and means for such work. Now all they could do was lay plastic sheeting to keep the books from the dirt or bare rock, stack or arrange them as best they could, try to sort them to some degree, and keep them hidden, keep them safe. Protect them, guard them, and, when there was time, read them. \\n But nobody in one lifetime could read more than a fragment of what was here, this broken labyrinth of words, this shattered, interrupted, immense story of a people and a world through the centuries, the millennia. \\n Odiedin sat down on the floor in one of the silent, gleam-lit caves where the books stretched away from the entrance in rows, like rows of mown grass but dark, vanishing into darkness. He sat down between two rows on the stone floor, picked up a small book with a worn cloth cover, and held it in his lap. He bowed his head over it without opening it. Tears ran down his cheeks. \\n They were free to go into the book caves as they wanted. In the days that followed, Sutty went back and back, wandering with the small, keen beam of an oil lamp to guide her, settling down here and there to read. She had her noter with her and scanned into it what she read, often whole books she didn’t have time to read. She read the texts of blessings, the protocols of ceremonies, recipes, prescriptions for curing cold sores and for living to a great age, stories, legends, annals, lives of famous maz, lives of obscure merchants, testimonies of people who lived thousands of years ago and a few years ago, tales of travel, meditations of mystics, treatises of philosophy and of mathematics, herbals, bestiaries, anatomies, geometries both real and metaphysical, maps of Aka, maps of imaginary worlds, histories of ancient lands, poems. All the poems in the world were here. \\n She knelt at a wooden crate filled with papers and worn, handmade books, the salvage of some small umyazu or town, saved from the bulldozer and the bonfire, carried here up the long hard ways of the Mountain to be safe, to be kept, to tell. By the light of her lamp on the rock floor she opened one of the books, a child’s primer. The ideograms were written large and without any qualifiers of aspect, mood, number, and Element. On one page was a crude woodcut of a man fishing from a humpbacked bridge.  THE   MOUNTAIN IS THE MOTHER OF THE RIVER,  said the ideograms beneath the picture. \\n She would stay in the caves reading till the words of the dead, the utter silence, the cold, the globe of darkness surrounding her, grew too strange, and she made her way back to daylight and the sound of living voices. \\n She knew now that all she would ever know of the Telling was the least hint or fragment of what there was to know. But that was all right; that was how it was. So long as it was here. \\n One maz couple was making a catalogue of the books in their Akan version of Sutty’s noter. They had been coming up to the caves for twenty years, working on the catalogue. They discussed it with her eagerly, and she promised to try to link her noter with theirs to duplicate and transfer the information. \\n Though the maz treated her with unfailing courtesy and respect, conversations were mostly formal and often difficult. They all had to speak in a language not their own, Dovzan. Though the Akans spoke it in public in their lives ‘down below,’ it was not the language in which they thought, and not the language of the Telling. It was the tongue of the enemy. It was a barrier. Sutty realized how much closer she had drawn to people in Okzat-Ozkat as she learned their Rangma speech. Several of the maz of the Library knew Hainish, which was taught in the Corporation universities as a mark of true education. It wasn’t of much use here, except perhaps in one conversation Sutty had with the young maz Unroy Kigno. \\n They went out together to enjoy the daylight for an hour and to sweep footsteps away. Since the helicopter had come so close, the first aircraft that had ever done so, the people of the Library took more care to sweep away paths or tracks in the snow that might lead an eye in the sky to the entrances of the caves. Sutty and Unroy had finished the rather pleasant job of throwing the light, dry snow about with brooms, and were taking a breather, sitting on boulders near the minules’ stable. \\n “What is history?” Unroy asked abruptly, using the Hainish word. “Who are historians? Are you one?” \\n “The Hainish say I am,” Sutty said, and they launched into a long and intense linguistico-philosophical discussion about whether history and the Telling could be understood as the same thing, or similar things, or not alike at all; about what historians did, what maz did, and why. \\n “I think history and the Telling are the same thing,” Unroy said at last. “They’re ways of holding and keeping things sacred.” \\n “What is sacredness?” \\n “What is true is sacred. What has been suffered. What is beautiful.” \\n “So the Telling tries to find the truth in events…or the pain, or the beauty?” \\n “No need to try to find it,” said Unroy. “The sacredness is there. In the truth, the pain, the beauty. So that the telling of it is sacred.” \\n Her partner, Kigno, was in a prison camp in Doy. He had been arrested and sentenced for teaching atheist religion and reactionary antiscience dogma. Unroy knew where he was, a huge steel-mill complex manned by prisoners, but no communication was possible. \\n “There are hundreds of thousands of people in the rehabilitation centers,” Unroy told Sutty. “The Corporation gets its labor cheap.” \\n “What are you going to do with your prisoner here?” \\n Unroy shook her head. “I wish he’d been killed like the other one,” she said. “He’s a problem we have no solution to.” \\n Sutty agreed in bitter silence. \\n The Monitor was being well looked after; several of the maz were professional healers. They had put him in a small tent by himself and kept him warm and fed. His tent was in a big cave among seven or eight tents belonging to guides and minule hostlers. There was always somebody there with an ear and an eye, as they put it. In any case there was no danger of his trying to escape until his wrenched back and badly damaged knee mended. \\n Odiedin visited him daily. Sutty had not yet brought herself to do so. \\n “His name is Yara,” Odiedin told her. \\n “His name is Monitor,” she said, contemptuous. \\n “Not any longer,” Odiedin said drily. “His pursuit of us was unauthorised. If he goes back to Dovza, he’ll be sent to a rehabilitation center.” \\n “A forced labor camp? Why?” \\n “Officials must not exceed their orders or take unauthorised action.” \\n “That wasn’t a Corporation helicopter?” \\n Odiedin shook his head. “The pilot owned it. Used it to bring supplies to mountain climbers in the South Range. Yara hired him. To look for us.” \\n “How strange,” Sutty said. “Was he after me, then?” \\n “As a guide.” \\n “I was afraid of that.” \\n “I was not.” Odiedin sighed. “The Corporation is so big, its apparatus is so clumsy, we little people in these big hills are beneath their notice. We slip through the mesh. Or we’ve done so for many years. So I didn’t worry. But he wasn’t the Corporation police. He was one man. One fanatic.” \\n “Fanatic?” She laughed. “He believes slogans? He loves the Corporation?” \\n “He hates us. The maz, the Telling. He fears you.” \\n “As an alien?” \\n “He thinks you’ll persuade the Ekumen to side with the maz against the Corporation.” \\n “What makes him think that?” \\n “I don’t know. He’s a strange man. I think you should talk with him.” \\n “What for?” \\n “To hear what he has to tell,” Odiedin said. \\n \\n She put it off, but conscience pushed her. Odiedin was no scholar, no sage like these maz from the lowlands, but he had a clear mind and a clear heart. On their long trek she had come to trust him entirely, and when she saw him crying over the books in the Library, she knew she loved him. She wanted to do what he asked her to do, even if it was to hear what the Monitor had to tell. \\n Maybe she could also tell the Monitor a little of what he ought to hear. In any case, sooner or later she’d have to face him. And the question of what to do about him. And the question of her responsibility for his being there. \\n Before the evening meal the next day, she went to the big cave where they had put him. A couple of minule handlers were gambling, tossing marked sticks, by lantern light. On the inner wall of the cave, a pure black concave curve ten meters high, the figure of the Tree had been incised by the dwellers here in centuries past: the single trunk, the two branches, the five lobes of foliage. Gold leaf still glittered in the lines of the drawing, and bits of crystal, jet, and moonstone winked among the carved leaves. Her eyes were well used to darkness now. The glow of a small electric light in a tent close under the back wall seemed as bright as sunlight. \\n “The Dovzan?” she asked the gamblers. One nodded with his chin toward the lighted tent. \\n The door flap was closed. She stood outside a while and finally said, “Monitor?” \\n The flap opened. She looked in cautiously. The small interior of the tent was warm and bright. They had fixed the injured man a bed pad with a slanted back support so he need not lie entirely flat. The cord of the door flap, a hand-crank-powered electric lamp, a tiny oil heater, a bottle of water, and a small noter lay within his reach. \\n He had been terribly bruised in the crash, and the bruising was still livid: blue-black-green all down the right side of his face, the right eye swollen half shut, both arms spotted with great brown-blue marks. Two fingers of his left hand were lightly splinted. But Sutty’s eyes were on the little device, the noter. \\n She entered the tent on her knees, and kneeling in the narrow clear space, picked up the device and studied it. \\n “It doesn’t transmit,” the man said. \\n “So you say,” Sutty said, beginning to play with it, to run it through its paces. After a while she said, ironically, “Apologies for going through your private files, Monitor. I’m not interested in them. But I have to test this things capacities.” \\n He said nothing. \\n The device was a recorder notebook, rather flashily designed but with several serious design flaws, like so much Akan technology—undigested techshit, she thought. It had no sending or receiving functions. She set it back down where he could reach it. \\n That alarm relieved, she was aware of her embarrassment and intense discomfort at being shut in this small space with this man. She wanted nothing but distance from him. The only way to make it was with words. \\n “What were you trying to do?” \\n “Follow you.” \\n “Your government had ordered you not to.” \\n After a pause he said, “I could not accept that.” \\n “So the cog is wiser than the wheel?” \\n He said nothing. He had not moved at all since opening the door flap. The rigidity of his body probably signified pain. She observed it with no feeling. \\n “If you hadn’t crashed, what would you have done? Flown back to Dovza and reported—what? Some cave mouths?” \\n He said nothing. \\n “What do you know about this place?” \\n As she asked the question, she realised that he had seen nothing of it but this one cave, a few hostlers, a few maz. He need never learn what it was. They could blindfold him—probably no need even for that: just get him out, get him away as soon as he could be moved. He had seen nothing but a travelers’ resting place. He had nothing to report. \\n “This is the Lap of Silong,” he said. “The last Library.” \\n “What makes you think that?” she said, made angry by disappointment. \\n “This is where you were coming. The Office of Ethical Purity has been looking for it for a long time. The place where they hide the books. This is it.” \\n “Who are ‘they,’ Monitor?” \\n “The enemies of the state.” \\n “O Ram!” she said. She sat back, as far from him as she could get, and hugged her knees. She spoke slowly, stopping after each sentence. “You people have learned everything we did wrong, and nothing we did right. I wish we’d never come to Aka. But since in our own stupid intellectual hubris we did so, we should either have refused you the information you demanded, or taught you Terran history. But of course you wouldn’t have listened. You don’t believe in history. You threw out your own history like garbage.” \\n “It was garbage.” \\n His brown skin was greyish where it wasn’t black-and-blue. His voice was hoarse and dogged. The man is hurt and helpless, she thought with neither sympathy nor shame. \\n “I know who you are,” she said. “You’re my enemy. The true believer. The righteous man with the righteous mission. The one that jails people for reading and burns the books. That persecutes people who do exercises the wrong way. That dumps out the medicine and pisses on it. That pushes the button that sends the drones to drop the bombs. And hides behind a bunker and doesn’t get hurt. Shielded by God. Or the state. Or whatever lie he uses to hide his envy and self-interest and cowardice and lust for power. It took me a while to see you, though. You saw me right away. You knew I was your enemy. Was unrighteous. How did you know it?” \\n “They sent you to the mountains,” he said. He had been looking straight forward, but he turned his head stiffly now to meet her eyes. “To a place where you would meet the maz. I did not wish any harm to you, yoz.” \\n After a moment she said, “Yoz!” \\n He had looked away again. She watched his swollen, unreadable face. \\n He reached out his good hand and began to pump the hand crank of his lamp up and down. The little square bulb inside it immediately brightened. For the hundredth time in a corner of her mind Sutty wondered why the Akans made their lightbulbs square. But the rest of her mind was full of shadows, anger, hate, contempt. \\n “Did your people let me go to Okzat-Ozkat as a decoy? A tool of your official ideologues? Were they hoping I’d lead them here?” \\n “I thought so,” he said after a pause. \\n “But you told me to keep away from the maz!” \\n “I thought they were dangerous.” \\n “To whom?” \\n “To…the Ekumen. And my government.” He used the old word, and corrected it: “The Corporation.” \\n “You don’t make sense, Monitor.” \\n He had stopped cranking the lamp. He looked straight ahead again. \\n “The pilot said, ‘There they are,’ and we came up alongside the path,” he said. “And he shouted, and I saw your group on the path. And smoke, behind you, smoke coming out of the rocks. But we were being thrown sideways, into the mountain. Into the rocks. The helicopter was thrown. Pushed.” \\n He held his injured left hand with his right hand, stiffly. He was controlling his shivering. \\n “Catabatic winds, yoz,” Sutty said after a while, softly. “And very high altitude for a helicopter.” \\n He nodded. He had told himself the same thing. Many times, no doubt. \\n “They hold this place sacred,” she said. \\n Where did that word come from? Not a word she used. Why was she tormenting him? Wrong, wrong. \\n “Listen, Yara—that’s your name?—don’t let rotten-corpse superstition get hold of you. I don’t think Mother Silong pays any attention to us at all.” \\n He shook his head, mute. Maybe he had told himself that, too. \\n She did not know what else to say to him. After a long silence, he spoke. \\n “I deserve punishment,” he said. \\n That shook her. \\n “Well, you got it,” she said finally. “And you’ll probably get more, one way or another. What are we going to do with you? That has to be decided. It’s getting on into late summer. They’re talking of leaving in a few weeks. So, until then you might as well take it easy. And get walking again. Because wherever you go from here, I don’t think you’ll be flying on the south wind.” \\n He looked at her again. He was unmistakably frightened. By what she had said? By whatever guilt had made him say, “I deserve punishment”? Or merely because lying helpless among the enemy was a frightening job? \\n He gave his stiff, painful, single nod and said, “My knee will be healed soon.” \\n As she went back through the caves, she thought that, grotesque as it seemed, there was something childlike about the man, something simple and pure. Then she said to herself, Simplistic, not simple, and what the hell does pure mean? Saintly, holy, all that stuff? (   Don’t Mother-Teresa me, girl,  Uncle Hurree muttered in her mind.) He was simpleminded, with his ‘enemy of the state’ jargon. And single-minded. A fanatic, as Odiedin had said. In fact, a terrorist. Pure and simple. \\n Talking with him had soured her. She wished she had not done it, had not seen him. Anxiety and frustration made her impatient with her friends. \\n Kieri, with whom she still shared the tent, though not lately the sleeping bag, was cheerful and affectionate, but her self-confidence was impervious. Kieri knew all she wanted to know. All she wanted of the Telling was stories and superstitions. She had no interest in learning from the maz here and never went into the caves of books. She had come for the mere adventure. \\n Akidan, on the other hand, was in a state of hero worship fatally mixed with lust. The guide Shui had gone back to her village soon after they came to the caves, leaving Akidan in his tent alone, and he had immediately fallen in love with Maz Unroy Kigno. He stuck to her like a minule kid to its mother, gazed at her with worshiping eyes, memorised her every word. Unfortunately, the only people under the old system whose sexual life was strictly regulated were the maz. Lifelong monogamy was their rule, whether they were or were not with their partner. The maz Sutty had known, as far as she could see, lived by this rule. And Akidan, a gentle-natured young man, had no real intention of questioning or testing it. He was simply smitten, head over heels, a pitiful victim of hormone-driven hagiolatry. \\n Unroy was sorry for him but did not let him know it. She discouraged him harshly, challenging his self-discipline, his learning, his capacity to become a maz. When he made his infatuation too clear, she turned on him and quoted a well-known tag from  The Arbor , “The two that are one are not two, but the one that is two is one…” It seemed a fairly subtle reproof, but Akidan turned pale with shame and slunk away. He had been miserable ever since. Kieri talked with him a good deal and seemed inclined to comfort him. Sutty rather wished she would. She didn’t want the seethe and sway of adolescent emotions; she wanted adult counsel, mature certainty. She felt that she must go forward and was at a dead end; must decide and did not know what was to be decided. \\n The Lap of Silong was wholly cut off from the rest of the world. No radios or any kind of communicators were ever brought there, lest signals be traced. News could come only up the northeastern paths or along the long, difficult way Sutty’s party had come from the southeast. This late in the summer, it was most unlikely that anyone else would arrive; indeed, as she had told the Monitor, the people here were already talking of leaving. \\n She listened to them discuss their plans. It was their custom to depart a few at a time and take different ways where the paths diverged. As soon as they could do so, they would join with the small caravans of summer-village people going down to the foothills. Thus the pilgrimage, the way to the caves, had been kept invisible for forty years. \\n It was already too late, Odiedin told her, to go back the way their group had come, on the southeast trail. The guides from the deep village had left for home promptly, and even so expected to meet storm and snow on Zubuam. The rest of them would have to go down into Amareza, the hill region northeast of Silong, and work their way around the end of the Headwaters Range and back up through the foothills to Okzat-Ozkat. On foot it would take a couple of months. Odiedin thought they could get lifts on trucks through the hill country, though they would have to split up into pairs to do so. \\n It all sounded frightening and improbable to Sutty. To follow her guides up into the mountains, to follow a hidden way through the clouds to a secret, sacred place, was one thing; to wander like a beggar, to hitchhike, anonymous and unprotected, in the vast countrysides of an alien world, was another thing altogether. She trusted Odiedin, yes, but she wanted very badly to get in touch with Tong Ov. \\n And what were they going to do with the Monitor? Let him loose to run and blab to the bureaus and the ministries about the last great cache of banned books? He might be in terminal disgrace, but before his bosses sent him off to the salt mines, they’d hear what he had to report. \\n And what would she say to Tong Ov when and if she ever did talk to him again? He had sent her to find Aka’s history, its lost, outlawed past, its true being, and she had found it. But then what? \\n What the maz wanted of her was clear and urgent: they wanted her to save their treasure. It was the only thing clear to her in the obscure turmoil of her thoughts and feelings since she had talked to the Monitor. \\n What she herself wanted—would have wanted, if it had been possible—was to stay here. To live in the caves of being, to read, to hear the Telling, here where it was still complete or nearly complete, still one unbroken story. To live in the forest of words. To listen. That was what she was fitted for, what she longed to do, and could not. \\n As the maz longed to do and could not. \\n “We were stupid, yoz Sutty,” said Goiri Engnake, a maz from the great city of Kangnegne in the center of the continent, a scholar of philosophy who had served fourteen years in an agricultural labor camp for disseminating reactionary ideology. She was a worn, tough, abrupt woman. “Carrying everything up here. We should have left it all over the place. Left the books with whoever had the books, and made copies. Spent our time copying, instead of bringing everything we have together where they can destroy it all at once. But you see we’re old-fashioned. People thought about how long it takes to copy, how dangerous it is to try to print. They didn’t look at the machines the Corporation started making, the ways to copy things in an instant, to put whole libraries into a computer. Now we’ve got our treasure where we can’t use those technologies. We can’t bring a computer up here, and if we could, how would we power it? And how long would it take to put all this into it?” \\n “With Akan technology, years,” Sutty said. “With what’s available to the Ekumen, a summer, maybe.” \\n Looking at Goiri’s face, she added, slowly, “If we were authorised to do so. By the Corporation of Aka. And by the Stabiles of the Ekumen.” \\n “I understand.” \\n They were in the ‘kitchen,’ the cave where they cooked and ate. It was sealed to the extent that it could be kept habitably warm, and was the gathering place, at all hours, for discussions and conversations. They had eaten breakfast and were each nursing along a cup of very weak bezit tea.  It starts the flow and reunites,  Iziezi murmured in her mind. \\n “Would you ask the Envoy to request such authorisation, yoz?” \\n “Yes, of course,” Sutty said. After a pause, “That is, I would ask him if he considered it feasible, or wise. If such a request indicated to your government that this place exists, we’d have blown your cover, maz.” \\n Goiri grinned at Sutty’s choice of words. They were of course speaking in Dovzan. “But maybe the fact that you know about it, that the Ekumen is interested in it, would protect the Library,” she said. “Prevent them from sending the police here to destroy it.” \\n “Maybe.” \\n “The Executives of the Corporation hold the Ekumen in very high respect.” \\n “Yes. They also hold its Envoys completely out of touch with everybody on Aka except ministers and bureaucrats. The Corporation has been given a great deal of useful information. In return, the Ekumen has been given a great deal of useless propaganda.” \\n Goiri pondered this, and asked at last, “If you know that, why do you allow it?” \\n “Well, Maz Goiri, the Ekumen takes a very long view. So long that it’s often hard for a short-lived being to live with. The principle we work on is that withholding knowledge is always a mistake—in the long run. So if asked to tell what we know, we tell it. To that extent, we’re like you, maz.” \\n “No longer,” Goiri said bitterly. “All we know, we hide.” \\n “You have no choice. Your bureaucrats are dangerous people. They’re believers.” Sutty sipped her tea. Her throat was dry. “On my world, when I was growing up, there was a powerful group of believers. They believed that their beliefs should prevail absolutely, that no other way of thinking should exist. They sabotaged the information storage networks and destroyed libraries and schools all over the world. They didn’t destroy everything, of course. It can be pieced back together. But…damage was done. That kind of damage is something like a stroke. One recovers, almost. But you know all that.” \\n She stopped. She was talking too much. Her voice was shaking. She was getting too close to it. Far too close to it. Wrong. \\n Goiri looked shaken too. “All I know of your world, yoz…” \\n “Is that we fly around in space ships bringing enlightenment to lesser, backward worlds,” Sutty said. Then she slapped one hand on the table and the other across her mouth. \\n Goiri stared. \\n “It’s a way the Rangma have of reminding themselves to shut up,” Sutty said. She smiled, but her hands were shaking now. \\n They were both silent for a while. \\n “I thought of you…of all the people of the Ekumen, as very wise, above error. How childish,” Goiri said. “How unfair.” \\n Another silence. \\n “I’ll do what I can, maz,” Sutty said. “If and when I get back to Dovza City. It might not be safe to try to get in touch with the Mobile by telephone from Amareza. I could say, for the wiretappers, that we got lost trying to hike up to Silong and found an eastern path out of the mountains. But if I turn up in Amareza, where I wasn’t authorised to go, they’ll ask questions. I can clam up, but I don’t think I can lie. I mean, not well…And there’s the problem of the Monitor.” \\n “Yes. I wish you would talk to him, yoz Sutty.” \\n Et tu, Brute?  said Uncle Hurree, his eyebrows sarcastic. \\n “Why, Maz Goiri?” \\n “Well, he is—as you call it—a believer. And as you say, that’s dangerous. Tell him what you told me about your Earth. Tell him more than you told me. Tell him that belief is the wound that knowledge heals.” \\n Sutty drank the last of her tea. The taste was bitter, delicate. “I can’t remember where I heard that. Not in a book. I heard it told.” \\n “Teran said it to Penan. After he was wounded fighting the barbarians.” \\n Sutty remembered now: the circle of mourners in the green valley under the great slopes of stone and snow, the body of the young man covered with thin, ice-white cloth, the voice of the maz telling the story. \\n Goiri said, “Teran was dying. He said, ‘My brother, my husband, my love, my self, you and I believed that we would defeat our enemy and bring peace to our land. But belief is the wound that knowledge heals, and death begins the Telling of our life.’ Then he died in Penan’s arms.” \\n The grave, yoz. Where it begins. \\n “I can carry that message,” Sutty said finally. “Though bigots have small ears.” \\n ',\n",
       " 'EIGHT \\n HIS TENT WAS LIGHTED  only by the faint glimmer of the heater. When she entered, he began pumping the little crank of the lantern. It took a long time to brighten, and the glow was small and feeble. \\n She sat down cross-legged in the empty half of the tent. As well as she could make out, his face was no longer swollen, though still discolored. The backboard was set so that he was sitting up almost straight. \\n “You lie here in the dark, night and day,” she said. “It must be strange. Sensory deprivation. How do you pass the time?” She heard the cold sharpness of her voice. \\n “I sleep,” he said. “I think.” \\n “Therefore you are…Do you recite slogans? Onward, upward, forward? Reactionary thought is the defeated enemy?” \\n He said nothing. \\n A book lay beside the bed pad. She picked it up. It was a schoolbook, a collection of poems, stories, exemplary lives, and so on, for children of ten or so. It took her some moments to realise that it was printed in ideograms, not in alphabet. She had practically forgotten that in the Monitor’s world, in modern Aka, everything was in alphabet, that the ideograms were banned, illegal, unused, forgotten. \\n “Can you read this?” she demanded, startled and somehow unnerved. \\n “Odiedin Manma gave it to me.” \\n “Can you read it?” \\n “Slowly.” \\n “When did you learn to read rotten-corpse primitive antiscientific writing, Monitor?” \\n “When I was a boy.” \\n “Who taught you?” \\n “The people I lived with.” \\n “Who were they?” \\n “My mother’s parents.” \\n His answers came always after a pause, and spoken low, almost mumbled, like the replies of a humiliated schoolboy to a goading questioner. Sutty was abruptly overcome with shame. She felt her cheeks burn, her head swim. \\n Wrong again. Worse than wrong. \\n After a prolonged silence she said, “I beg your pardon for the way I’ve been talking to you. I disliked your manner to me, on the boat and in Okzat-Ozkat. I came to hate you when I thought you responsible for destroying Maz Sotyu Ang’s herbary, his lifework, his life. And for hounding my friends. And hounding me. I hate the bigotry you believe in. But I’ll try not to hate you.” \\n “Why?” he asked. His voice was cold, as she remembered it. \\n “Hate eats the hater,” she quoted from a familiar text of the Telling. \\n He sat impassive, tense as always. She, however, began to relax. Her confession had relieved not only her shame but also the resentful oppression she had felt in his presence. She got her legs into a more comfortable semilotus, straightened her back. She was able to look at him instead of sneaking glances. She watched his rigid face for a while. He would not or could not say anything, but she could. \\n “They want me to talk to you,” she said. “They want me to tell you what life is like on Terra. The sad and ugly truths you’ll find at the end of the March to the Stars. So that maybe you’ll begin to ask yourself that fatal question: Do I know what I’m doing? But you probably don’t want to…Also I’m curious about what life’s like for someone like you. What makes a man a Monitor. Will you tell me? Why did you live with your grandparents? Why did you learn to read the old writing? You’re about forty, I should think. It was already banned when you were a child, wasn’t it?” \\n He nodded. She had put the book back down. He picked it up, seeming to study the flowing calligraphy of the title on the cover:  JEWEL FRUITS FROM THE TREE OF LEARNING. \\n “Tell me,” she said. “Where were you born?” \\n “Bolov Yeda. On the western coast.” \\n “And they named you Yara—‘Strong.’” \\n He shook his head. “They named me Azyaru,” he said. \\n Azya Aru. She had been reading about them just a day or so ago in a  History of the Western Lands , which Unroy showed her in one of their forays into the Library. A maz couple of two centuries ago, Azya and Aru had been the chief founders and apostles of the Telling in Dovza. The first boss maz. Dovzan culture heroes, until the secularisation. Under the Corporation, they had no doubt become culture villains, until they could be totally erased, whited out, deleted. \\n “Were your parents maz, then?” \\n “My grandparents.” He held the book as if it were a talisman. “The first thing I remember is my grandfather showing me how to write the word ‘tree’.” His finger on the cover of the book sketched the two-stroke ideogram. “We were sitting on the porch, in the shade, where we could see the sea. The fishing boats were coming in. Bolov Yeda is on hills above a bay. The biggest city on the coast. My grandparents had a beautiful house. There was a vine growing over the porch, up to the roof, with a thick trunk and yellow flowers. They held the Telling in the house every day. They went to the umyazu in the evenings.” \\n He used the forbidden pronoun, he/she/they. He was not aware of it, Sutty thought. His voice had become soft, husky, easy. \\n “My parents were schoolteachers. They taught the new writing at the Corporation school. I learned it, but I liked the old writing better. I was interested in writing, in books. In the things my grandparents taught me. They thought I was born to be a maz. Grandmother would say, ‘Oh, Kiem, let the child go play!’ But Grandfather would want me to stay and learn one more set of characters, and I always wanted to please him. To do better…Grandmother taught me the spoken things, the things children learned of the Telling. But I liked the writing better. I could make it look beautiful. I could keep it. The spoken words just went out like the wind, and you always had to say them all over again to keep them alive. But the writing stayed, and you could learn to make it better. More beautiful.” \\n “So you went to live with your grandparents, to study with them?” \\n He answered with the same quietness and almost dreamy ease. “When I was a little child, we lived there all together. Then my father became a school administrator. And my mother entered the Ministry of Information. They were transferred to Tambe, and then to Dovza City. My mother had to travel a great deal. They both rose very quickly in the Corporation. They were valuable officials. Very active. My grandparents said it would be better if I stayed home with them, while my parents were moving about and working so hard. So I did.” \\n “And you wanted to stay with them?” \\n “Oh, yes,” he said, with complete simplicity. “I was happy.” \\n The word seemed to echo in his mind, to jar him out of the quietness from which he had been speaking. He turned his head away from Sutty, an abrupt movement that brought vividly to her mind the moment on the street in Okzat-Ozkat when he said to her with passionate anger and pleading, “Do not betray us!” \\n They sat a while without speaking. No one else was moving about or talking in the Tree Cave. Deep silence in the Lap of Silong. \\n “I grew up in a village,” Sutty said. “With my uncle and aunt. Really my great-uncle and great-aunt. Uncle Hurree was thin and quite dark-skinned, with white bristly hair and eyebrows—terrible eyebrows. I thought he frowned lightning out of them, when I was little. Aunty was a tremendous cook and manager. She could organise anybody. I learned to cook before I learned how to read. But Uncle did teach me, finally. He’d been a professor at the University of Calcutta. A great city in my part of Terra. He taught literature. We had five rooms in the house in the village, and they were all full of books, except the kitchen. Aunty wouldn’t allow books in the kitchen. But they were piled all over my room, all around the walls, under the bed and the table. When I first saw the Library caves here, I thought of my room at home.” \\n “Did your uncle teach in the village?” \\n “No. He hid there. We hid. My parents were hiding in a different place. Lying low. There was a kind of revolution going on. Like yours here, but the other way round. People who…But I’d rather listen to you than talk about that. Tell me what happened. Did you have to leave your grandparents? How old were you?” \\n “Eleven,” he said. \\n She listened. He spoke. \\n “My grandparents were very active too,” he said. His tone had become leaden, labored, though he did not hesitate for words. “But not as loyal producer-consumers. They were leaders of a band of underground reactionary activists. Fomenting cult activities and teaching antiscience. I didn’t understand that. They took me to the meetings they organised. I didn’t know they were illegal meetings. The umyazu was closed, but they didn’t tell me that the police had closed it. They didn’t send me to Corporation school. They kept me home and taught me only superstition and deviant morality. Finally my father realised what they were doing. He and my mother had separated. He hadn’t been to see me for two years, but he sent for me. A man came. He came at night. I heard my grandmother talking very loudly, angrily. I’d never heard her talk that way. I got up and came into the front room. My grandfather was sitting in his chair, just sitting, he didn’t look at me or say anything. Grandmother and a man were facing each other across the table. They looked at me, and then the man looked at her. She said, ‘Go get dressed, Azyaru, your father wants you to come see him.’ I went and got dressed. When I came out again, they were still just the way they had been, exactly the same: Grandfather sitting like an old, deaf, blind man staring at nothing, and Grandmother standing with her hands in fists on the table, and the man standing there. I began crying. I said, ‘I don’t want to go, I want to stay here.’ Then Grandmother came and held my shoulders, but she pushed me. She pushed me at the man. He said, ‘Come on.’ And she said, ‘Go, Azyaru!’ And I…went with him.” \\n “Where did you go?” Sutty asked in a whisper. \\n “To my father in Dovza City. I went to school there.” A long silence. He said, “Tell me about…your village. Why you were hiding.” \\n “Fair’s fair,” Sutty said. “But it’s a long story.” \\n “All stories are long,” he murmured. The Fertiliser had said something like that once.  Short stories are only pieces of the long one,  he had said. \\n “What’s hard to explain is about God, on my world,” she said. \\n “I know God,” Yara said. \\n That made her smile. It lightened her for a moment. “I’m sure you do,” she said. “But what might be hard to understand, here, is what God is, there. Here, it’s a word and not much else. In your state theism, it seems to mean what’s good. What’s right. Is that right?” \\n “God is Reason, yes,” he said, rather uncertainly. \\n “Well, on Terra, the word has been an enormously important one for thousands of years, among many peoples. And usually it doesn’t refer so much to what’s reasonable as to what’s mysterious. What can’t be understood. So there are all kinds of ideas of God. One is that God is an entity that created everything else and is responsible for everything that exists and happens. Like a kind of universal, eternal Corporation.” \\n He looked intent but puzzled. \\n “Where I grew up, in the village, we knew about that kind of God, but we had a lot of other kinds. Local ones. A great many of them. They all were each other, though, really. There were some great ones, but I didn’t know much about them as a child. Only from my name. Aunty explained my name to me once. I asked, ‘Why am I Sutty?’ And she said, ‘Sutty was God’s wife.’ And I asked, ‘Am I Ganesh’s wife?’ Because Ganesh was the God I knew best, and I liked him. But she said, ‘No, Shiva’s.’ \\n “All I knew about Shiva then was that he has a lovely white bull that’s his friend. And he has long, dirty hair and he’s the greatest dancer in the universe. He dances the worlds into being and out of being. He’s very strange and ugly and he’s always fasting. Aunty told me that Sutty loved him so much that she married him against her father’s will. I knew that was hard for a girl to do in those days, and I thought she was very brave. But then Aunty told me that Sutty went back to see her father. And her father talked insultingly about Shiva and was extremely rude to him. And Sutty was so angry and ashamed that she died of it. She didn’t  do  anything, she just  died . And ever since then, faithful wives who die when their husbands die are called after her. Well, when Aunty told me that, I said, ‘Why did you name me for a stupid silly woman like that!’ \\n “And Uncle was listening, and he said, ‘Because Sati is Shiva, and Shiva is Sati. You are the lover and the griever. You are the anger. You are the dance.’ \\n “So I decided if I had to be Sutty, it was all right, so long as I could be Shiva too…” \\n She looked at Yara. He was absorbed and utterly bewildered. \\n “Well, never mind about that. It is terribly complicated. But all the same, when you have a lot of Gods, maybe it’s easier than having one. We had a God rock among the roots of a big tree near the road. People in the village painted it red and fed it butter, to please it, to please themselves. Aunty put marigolds at Ganesh’s feet every day. He was a little bronze God with an animal nose in the back room. He was Shiva’s son, actually. Much kinder than Shiva. Aunty recited things and sang to him. Doing pooja. I used to help her do pooja. I could sing some of the songs. I liked the incense and the marigolds…But these people I have to tell you about, the people we were hiding from, they didn’t have any little Gods. They hated them. They only had one big one. A big boss God. Whatever they said God said to do was right. Whoever didn’t do what they said God said to do was wrong. A lot of people believed this. They were called Unists.  One God, one Truth, one Earth.  And they…They made a lot of trouble.” \\n The words came out foolish, babyish, primer words for the years of agony. \\n “You see, my people, I mean all of us on Earth, had done a lot of damage to our world, fought over it, used it up, wasted it. There’d been plagues, famines, misery for so long. People wanted comfort and help. They wanted to believe they were doing something right. I guess if they joined the Unists, they could believe everything they did was right.” \\n He nodded. That he understood. \\n “The Unist Fathers said that what they called evil knowledge had brought all this misery. If there was no evil knowledge, people would be good. Unholy knowledge should be destroyed to make room for holy belief. They opposed science, all learning, everything except what was in their own books.” \\n “Like the maz.” \\n “No. No, I think that’s a mistake, Yara. I can’t see that the Telling excludes any knowledge, or calls any knowledge evil, or anything unholy. It doesn’t include anything of what Aka has learned in the last century from contact with other civilisations—that’s true. But I think that’s only because the maz didn’t have time to start working all that new information into the Telling before the Corporation State took over as your central social institution. It replaced the maz with bureaucrats, and then criminalised the Telling. Pushed it underground, where it couldn’t develop and grow. Called it unholy knowledge, in fact. What I don’t understand is why the Corporation thought such violence, such brutal use of power, was necessary.” \\n “Because the maz had had all the wealth, all the power. They kept the people ignorant, drugged with rites and superstitions.” \\n “But they  didn’t  keep the people ignorant! What is the Telling but teaching whatever’s known to whoever will listen?” \\n He hesitated, rubbed his hand over his mouth. “Maybe that was the old way,” he said. “Maybe once. But it wasn’t like that. In Dovza the maz were oppressors of the poor. All the land belonged to the umyazu. Their schools taught only fossilised, useless knowledge. They refused to let people have the new justice, the new learning—” \\n “Violently?” \\n Again he hesitated. \\n “Yes. In Belsi the reactionary mob killed two officials of the Corporation State. There was disobedience everywhere. Defiance of the law.” \\n He rubbed his hand hard over his face, though it must have hurt the sore, discolored temple and cheek. \\n “This is how it was,” he said. “Your people came here and they brought a new world with them. A promise of our own world made greater, made better. They wanted to give us that. But the people who wanted to accept that world were stopped, prevented, by the old ways. The old ways of doing everything. The maz mumbling forever about things that happened ten thousand years ago, claiming they knew everything about everything, refusing to learn anything new, keeping people poor, holding us back. They were wrong. They were selfish. Usurers of knowledge. They had to be pushed aside, to make way for the future. And if they kept standing in the way, they had to be punished. We had to show people that they were wrong. My grandparents were wrong. They were enemies of the state. They would not admit it. They refused to change.” \\n He had begun talking evenly, but by the end he was breathing in gasps, staring ahead of him, his hand clenched on the little primer. \\n “What happened to them?” \\n “They were arrested soon after I came to live with my father. They were in prison for a year in Tambe.” A long pause. “A great number of recalcitrant reactionary leaders were brought to Dovza City for a just public trial. Those who recanted were allowed to do rehabilitative work on the Corporate Farms.” His voice was colorless. “Those who did not recant were executed by the producer-consumers of Aka.” \\n “They were shot?” \\n “They were brought into the Great Square of Justice.” He stopped short. \\n Sutty remembered the place, a plain of pavement surrounded by the four tall, ponderous buildings housing the Central Courts. It was usually jammed with stalled traffic and hurrying pedestrians. \\n Yara began to talk again, still looking straight ahead at what he was telling. \\n “They all stood in the middle of the square, inside a rope, with police guarding them. People had come from all over to see justice done. There were thousands of people in the square. All around the criminals. And in all the streets leading to the square. My father brought me to see. We stood in a high window in the Supreme Court building. He put me in front of him so that I could see. There were piles of stones, building stones from umyazu that had been pulled down, big piles at the corners of the square. I didn’t know what they were for. Then the police gave an order, and everybody pushed in toward the middle of the square where the criminals were. They began to beat them with the stones. Their arms went up and down and…They were supposed to throw the rocks, to stone the criminals, but there were too many people. It was too crowded. Hundreds of police, and all the people. So they beat them to death. It went on for a long time.” \\n “You had to watch?” \\n “My father wanted me to see that they had been wrong.” \\n He spoke quite steadily, but his hand, his mouth gave him away. He had never left that window looking down into the square. He was twelve years old and stood there watching for the rest of his life. \\n So he saw his grandparents had been wrong. What else could he have seen? \\n Again a long silence. Shared. \\n To bury pain so deep, so deep you never need feel it. Bury it under anything, everything. Be a good son. A good girl. Walk over the graves and never look down.  Keep far the Dog that’s friend to men…  But there were no graves. Smashed faces, splintered skulls, blood-clotted grey hair in a heap in the middle of a square. \\n Fragments of bone, tooth fillings, a dust of exploded flesh, a whiff of gas. The smell of burning in the ruins of a building in the rain. \\n “So after that you lived in Dovza City. And entered the Corporation. The Sociocultural Bureau.” \\n “My father hired tutors for me. To remedy my education. I qualified well in the examinations.” \\n “Are you married, Yara?” \\n “I was. For two years.” \\n “No child?” \\n He shook his head. \\n He continued to gaze straight ahead. He sat stiffly, not moving. His sleeping bag was tented up over one knee on a kind of frame Tobadan had made to immobilise the knee and relieve the pain. The little book lay by his hand,  JEWEL FRUITS FROM THE TREE OF LEARNING. \\n Sutty bent forward to loosen her shoulder muscles, sat up straight again. \\n “Goiri asked me to tell you about my world. Maybe I can, because my life hasn’t been so different from yours, in some ways…I told you about the Unists. After they took over the government of our part of the country, they started having what they called cleansings in the villages. It got more and more unsafe for us. People told us we should hide our books, or throw them in the river. Uncle Hurree was dying then. His heart was tired, he said. He told Aunty she should get rid of his books, but she wouldn’t. He died there with them around him. \\n “After that, my parents were able to get Aunty and me out of India. Clear across the world, to another continent, in the north, to a city where the government wasn’t religious. There were some cities like that, mostly where the Ekumen had started schools that taught the Hainish learning. The Unists hated the Ekumen and wanted to keep all the extraterrestrials off Earth, but they were afraid to try to do it directly. So they encouraged terrorism against the Pales and the ansible installations and anything else the alien demons were responsible for.” \\n She used the English word  demon , there being no such word in Dovzan. She paused a while, took a deep, conscious breath. Yara sat in the intense silence of the listener. \\n “So I went to high school and college there, and started training to work for the Ekumen. About that time, the Ekumen sent a new Envoy to Terra, a man called Dalzul, who’d grown up on Terra. He came to have a great deal of influence among the Unist Fathers. Before very long they were giving him more and more control, taking orders from him. They said he was an angel—that’s a messenger from God. Some of them began to say he was going to save all mankind and bring them to God, and so…” But there was no Akan word for worship. “They lay down on the ground in front of him and praised him and begged him to be kind to them. And they did whatever he told them to do, because that was their idea of how to do right—to obey orders from God. And they thought Dalzul spoke for God. Or was God. So within a year he got them to dismantle the theocratic regime. In the name of God. \\n “Most of the old regions or states were going back to democratic governments, choosing their leaders by election, and restoring the Terran Commonwealth, and welcoming people from the other worlds of the Ekumen. It was an exciting time. It was wonderful to watch Unism fall to pieces, crumble into fragments. More and more of the believers believed Dalzul was God, but also more and more of them decided that he was the…opposite of God, entirely wicked. There was one kind called the Repentants, who went around in processions throwing ashes on their heads and whipping each other to atone for having misunderstood what God wanted. And a lot of them broke off from all the others and set up some man, a Unist Father or a terrorist leader, as a Savior of their own, and took orders from him. They were all dangerous, they were all violent. The Dalzulites had to protect Dalzul from the anti-Dalzulites. They wanted to kill him. They were always planting bombs, trying suicide raids. All of them. They’d always used violence, because their belief justified it. It told them that God rewards those who destroy unbelief and the unbeliever. But mostly they were destroying each other, tearing each other to pieces. They called it the Holy Wars. It was a frightening time, but it seemed as if there was no real problem for the rest of us—Unism was just taking itself apart. \\n “Well, before it got as far as that, when the Liberation was just beginning, my city was set free. And we danced in the streets. And I saw a woman dancing. And I fell in love with her.” \\n She stopped. \\n It had all been easy enough, to this point. This point beyond which she had never gone. The story that she had told only to herself, only in silence, before sleep, stopped here. Her throat began to tighten. \\n “I know you think that’s wrong,” she said. \\n After a hesitation, he said, “Because no children can be born of such union, the Committee on Moral Hygiene declared—” \\n “Yes, I know. The Unist Fathers declared the same thing. Because God created women to be vessels for men’s semen. But after freedom we didn’t have to hide for fear of being sent to revival camps. Like your maz couples who get sent to rehabilitation centers.” She looked at him, challenging. \\n But he did not take the challenge. He accepted what she said and waited, listening. \\n She could not talk her away around it or away from it. She had to talk her way through it. She had to tell it. \\n “We lived together for two years,” she said. Her voice came out so softly that he turned a little toward her to hear. “She was much prettier than me, and much more intelligent. And kinder. And she laughed. Sometimes she laughed in her sleep. Her name was Pao.” \\n With the name came the tears, but she held them back. \\n “I was two years older and a year ahead of her in our training. I stayed back a year to be with her in Vancouver. Then I had to go and begin training in the Ekumenical Center, in Chile. A long way south. Pao was going to join me when she graduated from the university. We were going to study together and be a team, an Observer team. Go to new worlds together. We cried a lot when I had to leave for Chile, but it wasn’t as bad as we thought it would be. It wasn’t bad at all, really, because we could talk all the time on the phone and the net and we knew we’d see each other in the winter, and then after the spring she’d come down and we’d be together forever. We  were  together. We were like maz. We were two that weren’t two, but one. It was a kind of pleasure or joy, missing her, because she was there, she was there to miss. And she told me the same thing, she said that when I came back in the winter, she was going to miss missing me…” \\n She had begun crying, but the tears were easy, not hard. Only she had to stop and sniff and wipe her eyes and nose. \\n “So I flew back to Vancouver for the holiday. It was summer in Chile, but winter there. And we…we hugged and kissed and cooked dinner. And we went to see my parents, and Pao’s parents, and walked in the park, where there were big trees, old trees. It was raining. It rains a lot there. I love the rain.” \\n Her tears had stopped. \\n “Pao went to the library, downtown, to look up something for the examinations she’d be taking after the holiday. I was going to go with her, but I had a cold, and she said, ‘Stay here, you’ll just get soaked,’ and I felt like lying around being lazy, so I stayed in our apartment, and fell asleep. \\n “There was a Holy War raid. It was a group called the Purifiers of Earth. They believed that Dalzul and the Ekumen were servants of the anti-God and should be destroyed. A lot of them had been in the Unist military forces. They had some of the weapons the Unist Fathers had stockpiled. They used them against the training schools.” \\n She heard her voice, as flat as his had been. \\n “They used drones, unmanned bombers. From hundreds of kilos away, in the Dakotas, They hid underground and pressed a button and sent the drones. They blew up the college, the library, blocks and blocks of the downtown. Thousands of people were killed. Things like that happened all the time in the Holy Wars. She was just one person. Nobody, nothing, one person. I wasn’t there. I heard the noise.” \\n Her throat ached, but it always did. It always would. \\n She could not say anything more for a while. \\n Yara asked softly, “Were your parents killed?” \\n The question touched her. It moved her to a place where she could respond. She said, “No. They were all right. I went to stay with them. After that I went back to Chile.” \\n They sat quietly. Inside the mountain, in the caves full of being. Sutty was weary, spent. She could see in Yara’s face and hands that he was tired and still in pain. The silence they shared after their words was peaceful, a blessing earned. \\n After a long time she heard people talking, and roused herself from that silence. \\n She heard Odiedin’s voice, and presently he spoke outside the tent: “Yara?” \\n “Come in,” Yara said. Sutty pulled the flap aside. \\n “Ah,” said Odiedin. In the weak light of the lantern his dark, high-cheekboned face peering in at them was an amiable goblin mask. \\n “We’ve been talking,” Sutty said. She emerged from the tent, stood beside Odiedin, stretched. \\n “I came for your exercises,” Odiedin said to Yara, kneeling at the entrance. \\n “Will he be on his feet soon?” she asked Odiedin. \\n “Using crutches is hard because of the way his back was hurt,” he answered. “Some of the muscles haven’t reattached. We keep working on it.” \\n He went into the tent on his knees. \\n She turned away, then turned back and looked in. To leave without a word, after such a conversation as they had had, was wrong. \\n “I’ll come again tomorrow, Yara,” she said. He made some soft reply. She stood up, looking at the cave in the faint glow reflected from the sides of the other tents. She could not see the carving of the Tree on the high back wall, only one or two of the tiny, winking jewels in its foliage. \\n The Tree Cave had an exit to the outside, not far from Yara’s tent. It led through a smaller cave to a short passage that ended in an arch so low that one had to crawl out into the light of day. \\n She emerged from that and stood up. She had pulled out her dark goggles, expecting to be dazzled, but the sun, hidden all afternoon by the great bulk of Silong, was setting or had set. The light was gentle, with a faint violet tinge. A little snow had fallen during the last few hours. The broad half circle of the cirque, like a stage seen from the backdrop, stretched away pale and untrodden to its outer edge. The air was quiet here under the wall of the mountain, but there at the edge, a hundred meters or so away, wind picked up and dropped the fine, dry snow in thin flurries and skeins, forever restless. \\n Sutty had been out to the edge only once. The cliff beneath it was sheer, slightly undercut, a mile-deep gulf. It had made her head swim, and as she stood there, the wind had tugged at her, gusting treacherously. \\n She gazed now over that small, ceaseless dance of the blown snow, across the emptiness of twilit air to Zubuam. The slopes of the Thunderer were vague, pale, remote in evening. She stood a long time watching the light die. \\n \\n She went to talk with Yara most afternoons now, after she had explored another section of the Library and had worked with the maz who were cataloguing it She and he never came back directly to what they had told each other of their lives, though it underlay everything they said, a dark foundation. \\n She asked him once if he knew why the Corporation had granted Tong’s request, allowing an offworlder outside the information-restricted, controlled environment of Dovza City. “Was I a test case?” she asked. “Or a lure?” \\n It was not easy for him to overcome the habit of his official life, of all official lives: to protect and aggrandise his power by withholding information, and to let silence imply he had information even when he didn’t. He had obeyed that rule all his adult life and probably could not have broken from it now, if he had not lived as a child within the Telling. As it was, he struggled visibly to answer. Sutty saw that struggle with compunction. Lying here, a prisoner of his injuries, dependent on his enemies, he had no power at all except in silence. To give it up, to let it go, to speak, took valor. It cost him all he had left. \\n “My department was not informed,” he began, then stopped, and began again: “I believe that there have,” and finally, doggedly, he started over, forcing himself through the jargon of his calling: “There have been high-level discussions concerning foreign policy for several years. Since an Akan ship is on its way to Hain, and being informed that an Ekumenical ship is scheduled to arrive next year, some elements within the Council have advocated a more relaxed policy. It was said that there might be profit if some doors were opened to an increase of mutual exchange of information. Others involved in decisions on these matters took the view that Corporation control of dissidence is still far too incomplete for any laxity to be advisable. A…a form of compromise was eventually attained among the factions of opinion on the matter.” \\n When Yara had run out of passive constructions, Sutty made a rough mental translation and said, “So I was the compromise? A test case, then. And you were assigned to watch me and report.” \\n “No,” Yara said with sudden bluntness. “I asked to. Was allowed to. At first. They thought when you saw the poverty and backwardness of Rangma, you’d go back quickly to the city. When you settled in Okzat-Ozkat, the Central Executive didn’t know how to exert control without giving offense. My department was overruled again. I advised that you be sent back to the capital. Even my superiors within the department ignored my reports. They ordered me back to the capital. They won’t listen. They won’t believe the strength of the maz in the towns and the countryside. They think the Telling is over!” \\n He spoke with intense and desolate anger, caught in the trap of his complex, insoluble pain. Sutty could think of nothing to say to him. \\n They sat there in a silence that gradually became more peaceful as they listened and surrendered to the pure silence of the caves. \\n “You were right,” she said at last. \\n He shook his head, contemptuous, impatient. But when she left, saying she would look in again tomorrow, he muttered, “Thank you, yoz Sutty.” Servile address, meaningless ritual phraseology. From the heart. \\n After that their conversations were easier. He wanted her to tell him about Earth, but it was hard for him to understand, and often, though she thought he did understand, he denied it. He protested: “All you tell me is about destruction, cruel actions, how things went badly. You hate your Earth.” \\n “No,” she said. She looked up at the tent wall. She saw the curve in the road just as you came to the village, and the roadside dust she and Moti played in. Red dust. Moti showed her how to make little villages out of mud and pebbles, planting flowers all around them. He was a whole year older than she was. The flowers wilted at once in the hot, hot sun of endless summer. They curled up and lay down and went back into the dark red mud that dried to silken dust. \\n “No, no,” she said. “My world’s beautiful beyond telling, and I love it, Yara. I’m telling you propaganda. I’m trying to tell you why, before your government started imitating what we do, they’d have done better to look at who we are. And at what we did to ourselves.” \\n “But you came here. And you had so much knowledge we didn’t have.” \\n “I know. I know. The Hainish did the same thing to us. We’ve been trying to copy the Hainish, to catch up to the Hainish, ever since they found us. Maybe Unism was a protest against that as much as anything. An assertion of our God-given right to be self-righteous, irrational fools in our own particularly bloody way and not in anybody else’s.” \\n He pondered this. “But we need to learn. And you said that the Ekumen thinks it wrong to withhold any knowledge.” \\n “I did. But the Historians study the way knowledge should be taught, so that what people learn is genuine knowledge, not a bit here and a bit there that don’t fit together. There’s a Hainish parable of the Mirror. If the glass is whole, it reflects the whole world, but broken, it shows only fragments, and cuts the hand that holds it. What Terra gave Aka is a splinter of the mirror.” \\n “Maybe that’s why the Executives sent the Legates back.” \\n “The Legates?” \\n “The men on the second ship from Terra.” \\n “Second ship?” Sutty said, startled and puzzled. “There was only one ship from Terra, before the one I came on.” \\n But as she spoke, she remembered her last long conversation with Tong Ov. He had asked her if she thought the Unist Fathers, acting on their own without informing the Ekumen, might have sent missionaries to Aka. \\n “Tell me about it, Yara! I don’t know anything about that ship.” \\n She could see him physically draw back very slightly, struggling with his immediate reluctance to answer. This had been classified information, she thought, known only to the upper echelons, not part of official Corporation history. Though they no doubt assumed  we  knew it. \\n “A second ship came and was sent back to Terra?” she asked. \\n “It appears so.” \\n She sent an exasperated silent message at his rigid profile: Oh, don’t come the tight-lipped bureaucrat on me now! She said nothing. After a pause, he spoke again. \\n “There were records of the visit. I never saw them.” \\n “What were you told about ships from Terra—can you tell me?” \\n He brooded a bit. “The first one came in the year Redan Thirty. Seventy-two years ago. It landed near Abazu, on the eastern coast. There were eighteen men and women aboard.” He glanced at her to check this for accuracy, and she nodded. “The provincial governments that were still in power then in the east decided to let the aliens go wherever they liked. The aliens said they’d come to learn about us, and to invite us to join in the Ekumen. Whatever we asked them about Terra and the other worlds they’d tell us, but they came, they said, not as tellers but as listeners. As yoz, not maz. They stayed five years. A ship came for them, and on the ship’s ansible they sent a telling of what they’d learned here back to Terra.” Again he looked at her for confirmation. \\n “Most of that telling was lost,” Sutty said. \\n “Did they get back to Terra?” \\n “I don’t know. I left Terra sixty years ago, sixty-one years now. If they got back during the Unist rule, or during the Holy Wars, they might have been silenced, or jailed, or shot…But there was a second ship?” \\n “Yes.” \\n “The Ekumen sponsored that first ship. But it didn’t sponsor another expedition from Terra, because the Unists had taken over. They cut communication with the Ekumen to a bare minimum. They kept closing ports and teaching centers, threatening aliens with expulsion, letting terrorists cripple the facilities, keeping them powerless. If a second ship came from Terra, the Unists sent it. I never heard anything about it, Yara. It certainly wasn’t announced to the common people.” \\n Accepting this, he said, “It came two years after the first ship left. There were fifty people on it, with a boss maz, a leader. His name was Fodderdon. It landed in Dovza, south of the capital. Its people got in touch with the Corporation Executives at once. They said Terra was going to give all its knowledge to Aka. They brought all kinds of information, technological information. They showed us how we’d have to stop doing things in the old, ignorant ways and change our thinking, to learn what they could teach us. They brought plans, and books, and engineers and theorists to teach us the techniques. They had an ansible on their ship, so that information could come from Terra as soon as we needed it.” \\n “A great big box of toys,” Sutty whispered. \\n “It changed everything. It strengthened the Corporation tremendously. It was the first step in the March to the Stars. Then…I don’t know what happened. All we were told was that Fodderdon and the others gave us information freely at first, but then began to withhold it and to demand an unfair price for it.” \\n “I can imagine what price,” Sutty said. \\n He looked his question. \\n “Your immortal part,” she said. There was no Akan word for soul. Yara waited for her to explain. “I imagine he said: You must believe. You must believe in the One God. You must believe that I alone, Father John, am God’s voice on Aka. Only the story I tell is true. If you obey God and me, we’ll tell you all the wonderful things we know. But the price of our Telling is high. More than any money.” \\n Yara nodded dubiously, and pondered. “Fodderdon did say that the Executive Council would have to follow his orders. That’s why I called him a boss maz.” \\n “That’s what he was.” \\n “I don’t know about the rest. We were told that there were policy disagreements, and the ship and the Legates were sent back to Terra. However…I’m not certain that that’s what happened.” He looked uncomfortable, and deliberated for a long time over what he was going to say. “I knew an engineer in New Alyuna who worked on the  Aka One .” He meant the NAFAL ship now on its way from Aka to Hain, the pride of the Corporation. “He said they’d used the Terran ship as a model. He may have meant they had the plans for it. But he made it sound as if he’d actually been in the ship. He was drunk. I don’t know.” \\n The fifty Unist missionary-conquistadors had very likely died in Corporation labor camps. But Sutty saw now how Dovza itself had been betrayed into betraying the rest of Aka. \\n It saddened her heart, this story. All the old mistakes, made over and over. She gave a deep sigh. “So, having no way to distinguish Unist Legates from Ekumenical Observers, you’ve handled us ever since with extreme distrust…You know, Yara, I think your Executives were wise in refusing the bargain Father John offered. Though probably they saw it simply as a power struggle. What’s harder to see is that even the gift of knowledge itself had a price attached. And still does.” \\n “Yes, of course it does,” Yara said. “Only we don’t know what it is. Why do your people hide the price?” \\n She stared at him, nonplussed. \\n “I don’t know,” she said. “I didn’t realise…I have to think about that.” \\n Yara sat back, looking tired. He rubbed his eyes and closed them. He said softly, “The gift is lightning,” evidently quoting some line of the Telling. \\n Sutty saw beautiful, arching ideograms, high on a shadowy white wall:  the twice-forked lightning-tee grows up from earth.  She saw Sotyu Ang’s worn, dark hands meet in the shape of a mountain peak above his heart.  The price is nothing… \\n They sat in the silence, following their thoughts. \\n After a long time, she asked, “Yara, do you know the story about Dear Takieki?” \\n He stared at her and then nodded. It was a memory from childhood, evidently, that required some retrieval. After a bit longer he said definitely, “Yes.” \\n “Was Dear Takieki really a fool? I mean, it was his mother who gave him the bean meal. Maybe he was right not to give it away, no matter what they offered him.” \\n Yara sat pondering. “My grandmother told me that story. I remember I thought I’d like to be able to walk anywhere, the way he did, without anybody looking after me. I was still little, my grandparents didn’t let me go off by myself. So I said he must have wanted to go on walking. Not stay at a farm. And Grandmother asked, ‘But what will he do when he runs out of food?’ And I said, ‘Maybe he can bargain. Maybe he can give the maz some of the bean meal and keep some, and take just a few of the gold coins. Then he could go on walking, and still buy food to eat when winter comes.’” \\n He smiled faintly, remembering, but his face remained troubled. \\n It was always a troubled face. She remembered it when it was hard, cold, closed. It had been beaten open. \\n He was worried for good reason. He was not progressing well with walking. His knee would still not bear weight for longer than a few minutes, and his back injury prevented him from using crutches without pain and risk of further damage. Odiedin and Tobadan worked with him daily, endlessly patient. Yara responded to them with his own dogged patience, but the look of trouble never left him. \\n \\n Two groups had already left the Lap of Silong, slipping away in the dawn light, a few people, a couple of minule, heavy-laden. No bannered caravans. \\n Life in the caves was managed almost wholly by custom and consensus. Sutty had noted the conscious avoidance of hierarchy. People scrupulously did not pull rank. She mentioned this to Unroy, who said, “That was what went wrong in the century before the Ekumen came.” \\n “Boss maz,” Sutty said tentatively. \\n “Boss maz,” Unroy confirmed, grinning. She was always tickled by Sutty’s slang and her Rangma archaisms. “The Dovzan Reformation. Power hierarchies. Power struggles. Huge, rich umyazu taxing the villages. Fiscal and spiritual usury! Your people came at a bad time, yoz.” \\n “The ships always come to the new world at a bad time,” Sutty said. Unroy glanced at her with a little wonder. \\n In so far as any person or couple was in charge of things at the Lap of Silong, it was the maz Igneba and Ikak. After general consensus was established, specific decisions and responsibilities were made by them. The order and times at which people were to depart was one such decision. Ikak came to Sutty at dinnertime one night. “Yoz Sutty, if you have no objection, your group will leave four days from now.” \\n “All of us from Okzat-Ozkat?” \\n “No. You, Maz Odiedin Manma, Long, and Ieyu, we thought. A small group, with one minule. You should be able to travel fast and get down into the hills before the autumn weather.” \\n “Very well, maz,” Sutty said. “I hate to leave the books unread.” \\n “Maybe you can come back. Maybe you can save them for our children.” \\n That burning, yearning hope they all shared, that hope in her and in the Ekumen: it frightened Sutty every time she saw its intensity. \\n “I will try to do that, maz,” she said. Then—“But what about Yara?” \\n “He’ll have to be carried. The healers say he won’t be able to walk any long distance before the weather changes. Your two young ones will be in the group with him, and Tobadan Siez, and two of our guides, and three minule with a handler. A large party, but it has to be so. They’ll go tomorrow morning, while this good weather holds. I wish we’d known the man would be unable to walk. We’d have sent them earlier. But they’ll take the Reban Path, the easiest.” \\n “What becomes of him when you reach Amareza?” \\n Ikak spread out her hands. “What can we do with him? Keep him prisoner! We have to! He could tell the police exactly where the caves are. They’d send people as soon as they could, plant explosives, destroy it. The way they destroyed the Great Library of Marang, and all the others. The Corporation hasn’t changed their policy. Unless  you  can persuade them to change it, yoz Sutty. To let the books be, to let the Ekumen come and study them and save them. If that happened, we’d let him go, of course. But if we do, his own people will arrest and imprison him for unauthorised actions. Poor man, he hasn’t a very bright future.” \\n “It’s possible that he won’t tell the police.” \\n Ikak, surprised, looked her question. \\n “I know he’d made it a personal mission to find the Library and destroy it. An obsession, in fact. But he…He was brought up by maz. And…” \\n She hesitated. She could not tell Ikak his grave-secret any more than she could tell her own. \\n “He had to become what he was,” she said finally. “But I think all that really makes sense to him is the Telling. I think he’s come back to that. I know he feels no enmity toward Odiedin or anybody here. Maybe he could stay with people in Amareza without being kept prisoner. Just keep out of sight.” \\n “Maybe,” Ikak said, not unsympathetic but unconvinced. “Except it’s very hard to hide somebody like that, yoz Sutty. He has an implanted ZIL. And he was a fairly high official, assigned to watch an Observer of the Ekumen. They’ll be looking for him. Once they get him, I’m afraid, whatever he feels, they can make him tell them anything he knows.” \\n “He could stay hidden in a village through the winter, maybe. Not go down into Amareza at all. I will need time, Maz Ikak Igneba—the Envoy will need time—to talk to people in Dovza. And if a ship comes next year, as it’s due to, then we can talk on the ansible with the Stabiles of the Ekumen about these matters. But it will take time.” \\n Ikak nodded. “I’ll speak with the others about it. We’ll do what we can.” \\n Sutty went immediately after dinner to Yara’s tent. \\n Both Akidan and Odiedin were already there, Akidan with the warm clothing Yara would need for the journey, Odiedin to reassure him about making it. Akidan was excited about leaving. Sutty was touched to see how kindly he spoke to Yara, his handsome young face alight. “Don’t worry, yoz,” he said earnestly, “it’s an easy path and we’ve got a very strong group. We’ll be down in the hills in a week.” \\n “Thank you,” Yara said, expressionless. His face had closed. \\n “Tobadan Siez will be with you,” Odiedin said. \\n Yara nodded. “Thank you,” he said again. \\n Kieri arrived with a thermal poncho Akidan had forgotten, and came crowding in with it, talking away. The tent was too full. Sutty knelt in the entrance and put her hand on Yara’s hand. She had never touched him before. \\n “Thank you for telling me what you told me, Yara,” she said, feeling hurried and self-conscious. “And for letting me tell you. I hope you—I hope things work out. Goodbye.” \\n Looking up at her, he gave his brief nod, and turned his head away. \\n She went back to her tent, anxious yet also relieved. \\n The tent was a mess: Kieri had thrown around everything she owned in preparation for packing it. Sutty looked forward to sharing a tent with Odiedin again, to order, silence, celibacy. \\n She had spent a long day working on the catalogue, tiring, tricky work with the balky and laborious Akan programs. She went to bed, intending to get up very early and see her friends off. She slept at once. Kieri’s return and the fuss of her packing scarcely disturbed her. It seemed about five minutes before the lamp was on again and Kieri was up, dressed, leaving. Sutty struggled out of her sleeping bag and said, “I’ll be at breakfast with you.” \\n But when she got to the kitchen, the people of the departing group weren’t there having the hot meal that would start them on their way. Nobody was there but Long, who was on cooking duty. \\n “Where is everybody, Long?” she asked, alarmed. “They haven’t left already, have they?” \\n “No,” Long said. \\n “Is something wrong?” \\n “I think so, yoz Sutty.” His face was distressed. He nodded toward the outer caves. She went to the entrance that led to them. She met Odiedin coming in. \\n “What’s wrong?” \\n “Oh Sutty,” Odiedin said. He made an incomplete, hopeless gesture. \\n “What is it?” \\n “Yara.” \\n “What?” \\n “Come with me.” \\n She followed him into the Tree Cave. He walked past Yara’s tent. There were a lot of people around it, but she did not see Yara. Odiedin strode on through the small cave with a rough floor, and from that to the short passage that led to the outside by the doorway arch they could get through only on hands and knees. \\n Odiedin stood up just outside it. Sutty emerged beside him. It was far from sunrise still, but the high pallor of the sky seemed wonderfully radiant and vast after the spaceless darkness of the caves. \\n “See where he went,” Odiedin said. \\n She looked down from the light to where he pointed. Snow lay ankle deep on the floor of the cirque. From the arch where they stood, boot tracks led straight out to the edge and back, tracks of three or four people, she thought. \\n “Not the tracks,” Odiedin said. “Those are ours. He was on hands and knees. He couldn’t walk. I don’t know how he could crawl on that knee. It’s a long way.” \\n She saw, now, the marks in the snow, heavy, dragging furrows. All the boot tracks kept to the left of them. \\n “Nobody heard him. Sometime after midnight, he must have crept out.” \\n Looking down, quite close to the arch, where the snow was thin on the black rock, she saw a blurred handprint. \\n “Out there at the edge,” Odiedin said, “he stood up. So that he could leap.” \\n Sutty made a little noise. She sank down squatting, rocking her body a little. No tears came, but her throat was tight, she could not breathe. \\n “Penan Teran,” she said. Odiedin did not understand her. “Onto the wind,” she said. \\n “He didn’t have to do this.” Odiedin’s voice was fierce, desolate. “It was wrong.” \\n “He thought it was right,” Sutty said. \\n ',\n",
       " 'NINE \\n THE CORPORATION AIRPLANE  that flew her from Soboy in Amareza to Dovza City gained altitude over the eastern Headwaters Range. Looking out the small window, due west, she saw a great, rough, rocky, bulky mountain: Zubuam. And then, soaring up behind it, the whiteness of the barrier wall, hiding somewhere in its luminous immensity the cirque and the caves of being. Above the serrate rim of the barrier, level with her eye, the horn of Silong soared white-gold against blue. She saw it whole, entire, this one time. The thin, eternal banner blew northward from the summit. \\n The trek south had been hard, two long weeks, on a good path but with bad weather along much of the way; and she had had no rest in Soboy. The Corporation had their police watching every road out of the Headwaters Range. Officials, very polite, very tense, had met her party just inside the city. “The Observer is to be flown at once to the capital.” \\n She had demanded to speak to the Envoy by telephone, and they had put the call through for her at the airfield. “Come along, as soon as you can,” Tong Ov said. “There’s been much alarm. We all rejoice at your safe return. Akan and alien alike. Though especially this alien.” \\n She said, “I have to make sure my friends are all right.” \\n “Bring them with you,” Tong said. \\n So Odiedin and the two guides from the village in the foothills west of Okzat-Ozkat were sitting together in the three seats behind hers. What Long and Ieyu made of it all she had no idea. Odiedin had explained or reassured them a little, and they had climbed aboard quite impassively. All four of them were tired, muzzy-headed, worn out. \\n The plane turned eastward. When she next looked down, she saw the yellow of snowless foothills, the silver thread of a river. The Ereha. Daughter of the Mountain. They followed the silver thread as it broadened and dulled to grey all the way down to Dovza City. \\n \\n “The base culture, under the Dovzan overlay, is not vertical, not militant, not aggressive, and not progressive,” Sutty said. “It’s level, mercantile, discursive, and homeostatic. In crisis I think they fall back on it. I think we can bargain with them.” \\n Napoleon Buonaparte called the English a nation of shopkeepers,  Uncle Hurree said in her mind.  Maybe not altogether a bad thing? \\n Too much was in her mind. Too much to tell Tong; too much to hear from him. They had had little over an hour to talk, and the Executives and Ministers were due to arrive any minute. \\n “Bargain?” asked the Envoy. They were speaking in Dovzan, since Odiedin was present. \\n “They owe us,” Sutty said. \\n “Owe us?” \\n Chiffewar was neither a militant nor a mercantile culture. There were concepts that Chiffewarians, for all their breadth and subtlety of mind, had trouble understanding. \\n “You’ll have to trust me,” Sutty said. \\n “I do,” said the Envoy. “But please explain, however cryptically, what this bargain is.” \\n “Well, if you agree that we should try to preserve the Library at Silong… \\n “Yes, of course, in principle. But if it involves interference with Akan policy—” \\n “We’ve been interfering with Aka for seventy years.” \\n “But how could we arbitrarily refuse them information—since we couldn’t undo that first tremendous gift of technological specifics?” \\n “I think the point is that it wasn’t a gift. There was a price on it: spiritual conversion.” \\n “The missionaries,” Tong said, nodding. Earlier in their hurried talk, he had shown the normal human pleasure at having his guess confirmed. \\n Odiedin listened, grave and intent. \\n “The Akans saw that as usury. They refused to pay it. Ever since then, we’ve actually given them more information than they asked for.” \\n “Trying to show them that there are less exploitive modes—yes.” \\n “The point is that we’ve always given it freely, offered it to them.” \\n “Of course,” Tong said. \\n “But Akans pay for value received. In cash, on the spot. As they see it, they didn’t pay for all the blueprints for the March to the Stars, or anything since. They’ve been waiting for decades for us to tell them what they owe us. Till we do, they’ll distrust us.” \\n Tong removed his hat, rubbed his brown, satiny head, and replaced the hat a little lower over his eyes. “So we ask them for information in return?” \\n “Exactly. We’ve given them a treasure. They have a treasure we want. Tit for tat, as we say in English.” \\n “But to them it’s not a treasure. It’s sedition and a pile of rotten-corpse superstition. No?” \\n “Well, yes and no. I think they know it’s a treasure. If they didn’t, would they bother blowing it up?” \\n “Then we don’t have to persuade them that the Library of Silong is valuable?” \\n “Well, we do want them to be aware that it’s worth fully as much as any information we gave them. And that its value depends on our having free access to it. Just as they have free access to all the information we give them.” \\n “Tat for tit,” Tong said, absorbing the concept if not quite the phrase. \\n “And another thing—very important—That it’s not just the books in the Lap of Silong that we’re talking about, but all the books, everywhere, and all the people who read the books. The whole system. The Telling. They’ll have to decriminalise it.” \\n “Sutty, they’re not going to agree to that.” \\n “Eventually they must. We have to try.” She looked at Odiedin, who was sitting erect and alert beside her at the long table. “Am I right, maz?” \\n “Maybe not everything all at once, yoz Sutty,” Odiedin said. “One thing at a time. So there’s more to keep bargaining with. And for.” \\n “A few gold coins, for some of the bean meal?” \\n It took Odiedin a while. “Something like that,” he said at last, rather dubiously. \\n “Bean meal?” the Envoy inquired, looking from one to the other. \\n “It’s a story we’ll have to tell you,” Sutty said. \\n But the first Executives were coming into the conference room. Two men and two women, all in blue and tan. There were, of course, no formalities of greeting, no servile addresses; but there had to be introductions. Sutty looked into each face as the names were named. Bureaucrat faces. Government faces. Self-assured, smooth, solid. Closed. Endlessly repeatable variations on the Monitor’s face. But it was not the Monitor’s, it was Yara’s face that she held in her mind as the bargaining began. \\n His life, that was what underwrote her bargaining. His life, Pao’s life. Those were the intangible, incalculable stakes. The money burned to ashes, the gold thrown away. Footsteps on the air. \\n \\n \\n \\n ',\n",
